## 🗺️ The Martial Arts Haven Universe

**Universal Law:** Individuals with combat aptitude are recognized by the universe itself. Those with low aptitude spawn in other realities.

**The Beggars Sect:** Mysterious, vague, spread out. Looked down upon by most, but the wise know better - you never know if you're facing a hidden master.

**Factions:**
- The Beggars Sect (protagonist's home)
- Urban Thugs (street-level fighters)
- Hypermodern Spartans (futuristic authority)
- Lone Wolves (independent masters)
- Many more to discover...

**This is just the beginning.** Future games will explore other realms, other characters, other stories in the Martial Arts Haven multiverse.
