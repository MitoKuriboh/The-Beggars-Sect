## Unlock Progression Example

### Pure Blade Build (90/5/5)

**Prologue (50 mastery):**
- Unlocks: Force aspect (30% Blade)
- Unlocks: Shattering Strike (30% + Force + 50 mastery)
- Available: Palm Strike, Flowing Strike, Shattering Strike

**Training Loop (100 mastery):**
- Unlocks: Burst aspect (100 mastery)
- Ready for: Explosive Fist (needs 60% Blade + Burst)

**Post-Prologue (~60% Blade, 150 mastery):**
- Unlocks: Explosive Fist (60% + Burst + 100 + prereq)
- Technique Tree: Shattering Strike → Explosive Fist

---

### Balanced Build (34/33/33)

**Prologue (50 mastery):**
- Unlocks: None (no path reaches 30%)
- Available: Palm Strike, Flowing Strike only

**After Training (200 mastery, slight lean to 40/30/30):**
- Unlocks: Primary aspect for dominant path
- Unlocks: One starter technique
- Builds start differentiating

**Philosophy:** Balanced builds stay generalist longer, unlock specialized techniques later

---

### Hybrid Blade/Shadow (60/10/30)

**Mid-Game:**
- Unlocks: Shattering Strike (Blade starter)
- Unlocks: Vital Point Strike (Shadow starter)
- Strategy: Armor break + vital strikes for debuff stacking

## Design Notes

### Power Balance

**Starter Techniques (30% path):**
- Power: 14-18
- Chi Cost: 6-8
- Unlock at 50 mastery

**Advanced Techniques (50-60% path):**
- Power: 20-26
- Chi Cost: 8-14
- Unlock at 100+ mastery
- Require prerequisites

### Aspect Alignment

| Path | Starter Aspect | Advanced Aspect |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Blade | Force | Burst |
| Stream | Flow | Sense |
| Shadow | Precision | Sense |

**Note:** Both Stream and Shadow use Sense for advanced techniques, creating interesting build decisions.

### Mastery Investment

Players must invest in **using** techniques to unlock mastery bonuses:
- Level 2: 10 uses (+basic improvements)
- Level 3: 25 uses (+significant bonuses)
- Level 4: 50 uses (+major upgrades)
- Level 5: 100 uses (+signature effects)

This rewards commitment to specific techniques while maintaining flexibility.

## Integration with Training Loop

**Prologue Flow:**
1. Player starts balanced (33/33/34)
2. Story choices shift paths toward specialization
3. At ~30% in one path, primary aspect unlocks
4. Training earns mastery points
5. At 50 mastery + 30% path + aspect = **first path technique unlocked**
6. Player can now use that technique in training
7. Using it builds mastery levels (10/25/50/100 uses)
8. More training → more mastery points → unlock advanced techniques

**Result:** Deeply interconnected progression loop where:
- Story choices → Path percentages
- Path percentages → Aspect unlocks
- Aspects + Mastery → Technique unlocks
- Using techniques → Mastery levels → Power spikes
