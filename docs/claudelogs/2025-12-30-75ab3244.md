# Session: 75ab3244
**Date:** 2025-12-30 | **Project:** Beggars Sect (game) | **Status:** ✅ Complete

## TL;DR
Completed comprehensive atmospheric polish across all game screens. Applied unified wuxia theme to Combat, Story, and Exploration screens. Fixed AspectLoadoutDisplay TODO with full slot selection UI.

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Extended decorations.ts with combat/story-specific elements | Centralizes all decorative constants for consistency | Inline strings in each component |
| Used `useState(getRandomQuote)` lazy init | Prevents quote changing on re-renders | useEffect with empty deps |
| Keyboard numbers (1/2/3) for slot selection | Direct and intuitive for terminal UI | Arrow key tab navigation |

## Changes
| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `src/ui/theme/decorations.ts` | Extended | Added COMBAT_DECORATIONS, STORY_DECORATIONS, COMBAT_QUOTES |
| `src/ui/combat/CombatScreen.tsx` | Modified | Atmospheric headers, dramatic result banners, combat quotes |
| `src/ui/story/StoryScreen.tsx` | Modified | Yin-yang flourishes, chapter-end/game-end banners |
| `src/ui/status/AspectLoadoutDisplay.tsx` | Modified | Full slot selection UI with keyboard navigation |
| `src/ui/story/ExplorationMenu.tsx` | Modified | Decorative flourishes, progress indicator, symbols |

## Context for Next Session
- All screens now have unified wuxia atmospheric styling
- AspectLoadoutDisplay TODO is resolved - slot selection fully functional
- Remaining TODO in codebase: Chapter 1 skip in App.tsx (intentional for testing)

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding combat animations (damage flash, chi pulse effects)
2. Chapter 1 content creation (story continuation)
3. Sound design integration if pursuing web version
4. Achievement/milestone system for player progression

## Verification
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Build | ✅ Clean |
| Lint | ✅ 0 warnings |
| Tests | ✅ 148 passing |
