# Session: 7c18da57
**Date:** 2025-12-30 | **Project:** Beggars Sect Game | **Status:** ✅ Complete

## TL;DR
Added SYSTEM-DNA compliance: Created CODE-DNA.md consolidating patterns from AAA architecture docs, created ARCHITECTURE.md with 7 ADRs, added `@types/*` path alias to tsconfig. Build verified.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Keep types in `src/types/` | Already well-organized, path aliases exist | Move to `src/lib/types/` (unnecessary restructuring) |
| Add `@types/*` alias | Cleaner imports, matches other aliases | Use `@/types/*` (less explicit) |
| 7 ADRs in ARCHITECTURE.md | Document key architectural decisions | Separate ADR files (overkill) |

## Changes

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `docs/CODE-DNA.md` | Created | Consolidated patterns from AAA architecture docs |
| `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Created | 7 ADRs documenting key decisions |
| `tsconfig.json` | Modified | Added `@types/*` path alias |

## Files Created

### docs/CODE-DNA.md
- Project structure overview
- Path alias documentation
- Core patterns: centralized config, custom hooks, design system
- Game logic patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer
- Type patterns: discriminated unions, `as const`
- Anti-patterns list

### docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md
- System overview diagram
- Decision index table
- 7 ADRs:
  - ADR-001: React/Ink for CLI UI
  - ADR-002: Singleton GameStore
  - ADR-003: Centralized GameBalance config
  - ADR-004: Custom hooks over HOCs
  - ADR-005: Factory pattern for entities
  - ADR-006: Types at `src/types/`
  - ADR-007: Pattern-based AI
- Layer dependency diagram
- Future considerations

## Context for Next Session
- CODE-DNA.md is at `docs/CODE-DNA.md`
- ARCHITECTURE.md is at `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `@types/*` alias now available for cleaner imports
- Build verified working after changes

## Next Steps
1. Consider migrating existing imports to use `@types/*` alias
2. Review ADRs with Mito if any need adjustment
3. Continue with Chapter 1 content development
