# Session Summary: Scope Down & Integration Planning

**Date:** 2025-12-05
**Session:** Scoping & Planning
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## ✅ Completed This Session

### 1. **Website Analysis**
Analyzed genkaw.com structure:
- Data-driven architecture (site-content.ts)
- Lab section with experiments
- Modular, expandable design
- Perfect for adding projects

### 2. **Integration Complete**
Added The Beggars Sect to genkaw.com Lab section:
- Status: "active"
- Category: "Game Development"
- Tags: TypeScript, Ink, Claude AI, Game Design, CLI
- Learned: "Design-first approach: Complete 2000+ lines of documentation before writing a single line of game code."

**Result:** Game now visible on genkaw.com as active project

### 3. **Comprehensive MVP Plan Created**
Created `MVP_PLAN.md` (3,800+ lines) covering:

**Scoped MVP Definition:**
- ✅ 3 chapters (not 5)
- ✅ 3 stances (not 4)
- ✅ 15-20 techniques
- ✅ Core combat + AI enemies
- ❌ Environmental combat → v1.5
- ❌ Community features → v2.0

**Documentation Split Plan:**
- CORE_COMBAT.md → Pure mechanics
- AI_INTEGRATION.md → AI/automation
- GAME_DESIGN.md → Story/world (reduced)
- TECHNIQUES.md → Complete database

**Feedback System Design:**
- Simple web form for feedback collection
- Database schema (feedback + analytics)
- Privacy-focused (anonymous UUIDs)
- Planned for Week 10-11

**12-Week Realistic Roadmap:**
- Week 1-2: Complete design (docs, spreadsheet, mockups)
- Week 3-4: Core combat prototype
- Week 5-6: Chapter 1 + AI integration
- Week 7-8: Chapters 2-3, all systems
- Week 9-10: Balance, polish, feedback system
- Week 11-12: Testing, documentation, LAUNCH

---

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Scope Locked ✅
- **IN:** Core combat, 3 chapters, AI enemies, 3 stances
- **OUT:** Environmental combat, 4th stance, chapters 4-5

### Timeline Realistic ✅
- 12 weeks for scoped MVP
- Weekly deliverables
- Decision points at key milestones
- Buffer for iteration

### Documentation Strategy ✅
- Split into 4 focused docs
- Balance spreadsheet critical
- CLI mockups before coding
- Lock features after Week 2

### Feedback Strategy ✅
- Separate web form (not in-game)
- Simple database solution
- Anonymous analytics
- Launches Week 10-11

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes This Plan Work

**Realistic Scope:**
- Cut from 5 chapters → 3
- Focus on core combat + AI
- Save advanced features for v1.5/v2.0

**Design-First:**
- Complete all docs before coding
- Know exactly what to build
- No mid-development confusion

**Clear Milestones:**
- Weekly deliverables
- Decision points
- Can adjust if needed

**Leverages Strengths:**
- AI integration (core mission)
- Automation showcase
- Non-traditional coding
- Original IP

### Risk Mitigation

**High-risk items identified:**
1. Combat feel (Week 4) → Iterate until fun
2. AI costs (Week 6) → Monitor, set limits
3. Scope creep → Lock features Week 2
4. Balance → Spreadsheet planning
5. Playtesters → Recruit early

**Contingencies in place:**
- Buffer weeks
- Decision points
- Simplified features
- Clear success metrics
