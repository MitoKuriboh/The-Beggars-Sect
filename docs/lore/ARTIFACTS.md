## The Dog Beating Staff (打狗棒)

*"The weapon that chooses the worthless"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Weapon (Staff) |
| Origin | Ancient Layer / Wei Zhong |
| Current Location | Sealed cave above Forgotten Temple |
| Status | Awaiting wielder |
| Rarity | Unique |

### Physical Description

**Appearance:**
A simple bamboo staff, approximately six feet long, worn smooth by age. Unremarkable to the eye—just old wood that should have rotted centuries ago.

**True Appearance:**
When held by one with inverse chi, the staff reveals its nature: veins of pale light pulse through the wood, ancient characters become visible, and it feels alive in a way no weapon should.

### History

**The True Origin:**
The Dog Beating Staff predates Wei Zhong—he found it, he didn't create it. In the Ancient Layer, among relics of the forgotten civilization, the staff waited. Wei Zhong recognized it as a chi-conducting artifact and gave it to the Beggars Sect with prophecy:

> *"Guard this until one arrives who flows backward through the world. The staff will know them. They will know the staff."*

**What Wei Zhong Understood:**
The staff was designed for inverse chi specifically. The ancient civilization knew about inverse meridians—possibly cultivated them deliberately. The staff is a key to understanding what the Array was meant to do.

**Five Hundred Years of Waiting:**
The Beggars Sect has guarded the staff's location for centuries. Multiple "candidates" have attempted to wield it. All failed—the staff rejected them with pain, burns, sometimes death.

**The Hollow One's Discovery:**
50 years ago, Wei Lin (The Hollow One) found the staff. Their perfect S-grade standard chi meant they couldn't wield it—but they recognized its importance. They've guarded its location since, waiting for the true wielder.

### Powers

**Known Abilities:**

| Power | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Inverse Amplification | Multiplies inverse chi output by unknown factor |
| Technique Transmission | Teaches techniques through chi resonance |
| Truth Revelation | Those struck see the truth about their aptitude |
| Wielder Recognition | Only accepts inverse chi users |
| Self-Preservation | Cannot be destroyed by standard means |

**Theoretical Abilities (Unconfirmed):**
- Connection to Ancient Layer consciousness
- Ability to disable or modify the Array
- Memory storage of all previous wielders
- Dimensional properties (why it doesn't age)

### The Techniques

The staff comes with a complete martial art:

**Dog Beating Staff Art (36 Techniques)**

*Foundation (Stances 1-12):*
Basic strikes, blocks, sweeps designed to humiliate rather than kill—hence "dog beating"

*Intermediate (Stances 13-24):*
Combination attacks, chi projection through staff, area control

*Advanced (Stances 25-36):*
Techniques so devastating they've never been fully demonstrated

**Philosophy:**
The Dog Beating Staff art embodies beggars' values: the strikes target pride, not life. The philosophy is correction, not destruction. "Beat the dog until it remembers it's a dog—then let it go."

### Narrative Function

**In MVP (Chapter 3):**
- Location revealed by Hollow One
- Li Wei approaches sealed cave
- Cliffhanger: seal begins to open

**In Sequel:**
- Li Wei claims the staff
- Learns the 36 techniques
- Discovers truth about Ancient Layer
- Uses staff's power against the Array

### The Prophecy Connection

> *"The staff shall find them"* - The Dog Beating Staff
> *"Only one who flows backward may enter"* - Cave seal

Li Wei is the first in 500 years whose chi signature matches the staff's requirements. Whether this is destiny, design, or coincidence is never answered.

## The Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms (降龙十八掌)

*"The original beggar art"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Technique Collection |
| Origin | Beggars Sect Founder |
| Current Location | Beggars Sect Archive (partial) |
| Status | Incomplete, scattered |
| Rarity | Legendary |

### Description

Not a physical artifact, but a legendary technique set so significant it's treated as one. The Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms are the original inverse chi techniques, developed by the Beggars Sect founder.

### History

**The Creation:**
The founder (name lost) developed these techniques using inverse chi principles found in the Ancient Layer. Each palm strike channeled desperation and emptiness into devastating power.

**The Scattering:**
During the Redistribution persecutions, the complete manual was destroyed. Surviving fragments were memorized by different elders who fled in different directions. No single person today knows all eighteen.

**Current State:**
The Beggars Sect has reconstructed approximately 12 of the 18 palms. The remaining 6 exist only in fragments, rumors, and possibly the Ancient Layer itself.

### Known Palms

| Palm | Name | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Proud Dragon Repents | Complete |
| 2 | Flying Dragon in the Sky | Complete |
| 3 | Dragon Swimming in the Abyss | Complete |
| 4 | Hidden Dragon | Complete |
| 5 | Sudden Surge | Complete |
| 6 | Two Dragons Fighting | Complete |
| 7 | Fish Leaping over Dragon Gate | Partial |
| 8 | Seeing Dragon in Field | Complete |
| 9 | Double Dragon Fetching Water | Complete |
| 10 | Dragon's Tail | Complete |
| 11 | Dragon Battling in the Wild | Partial |
| 12 | Stepping on Frost | Complete |
| 13-18 | Unknown Names | Lost |

### Power Level

Each palm is devastating alone:
- Single palm strike can shatter stone
- Chi projection extends strike range
- Inverse nature bypasses standard defenses
- Combined palms multiply power exponentially

**The Legend:**
A master of all 18 palms allegedly defeated an army. The technique's loss may be why the Beggars Sect fell during Redistribution.

### Narrative Function

**In MVP:**
Li Wei learns fragments of these techniques through the three stances. His "Flowing Strike," "Weathered Palm," and "Hungry Palm" are simplified derivatives.

**In Sequel:**
- Dog Beating Staff contains complete technique memory
- Li Wei recovers all 18 palms
- Uses them against Initiative/Array

## Jade Cloud Sword (玉云剑)

*"The merchant's blade that never trades"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Weapon (Sword) |
| Origin | Pre-Redistribution |
| Current Location | Jade Cloud Sect Vault |
| Status | Held by Sect Master |
| Rarity | Unique |

### Description

A straight sword of pale jade-colored metal, supposedly forged from ore found in the Ancient Layer. It's the symbol of Jade Cloud Sect leadership and hasn't been drawn in combat for over a century.

### Powers

- Chi-conducting metal amplifies techniques
- Self-repairing when chi-fed
- Allegedly cuts through any standard material
- True abilities unknown (never used)

### The Secret

The Jade Cloud Sword can't cut inverse chi users. The sect discovered this during Redistribution battles with Beggars and has hidden the fact since. Their legendary weapon is useless against the prophecy's fulfillment.

### Narrative Function

**In MVP:** Referenced as Jade Cloud's symbol
**In Sequel:** Fails against Li Wei, exposing sect vulnerability

## Iron Mountain Gauntlets (铁山拳套)

*"The fists that shattered the Hundred Sects"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Weapon (Gauntlets) |
| Origin | Hundred Sect War era |
| Current Location | Iron Mountain Vault |
| Status | Ceremonial |
| Rarity | Unique |

### Description

Heavy iron gauntlets supposedly worn by Iron Mountain's founder during the Hundred Sect War. They've been passed down as symbol of military authority.

### Powers

- Extreme chi conductivity
- Impact multiplication
- Weight manipulation (heavy or light at will)
- True abilities lost to time

### The Secret

The original gauntlets were destroyed centuries ago. Current "gauntlets" are replicas with minimal power. Iron Mountain's leadership knows but perpetuates the legend.

### Narrative Function

Demonstrates how history becomes myth, and how the powerful control narrative.

# FORMATIONS AND ARRAYS

---

## The Aptitude Array (资质阵)

*"The formation that measures souls"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Formation (Measurement) |
| Origin | Ancient Layer / Wei Zhong |
| Current Location | Measuring Spire base |
| Status | Active for 147 years |
| Rarity | Unique |

### Description

The massive chi formation that measures aptitude, grades individuals, and (secretly) may enforce the categories it assigns. The defining artifact of modern Haven.

### Physical Structure

**Visible Components:**
- Crystal matrix in Measuring Spire
- Chi-conducting channels throughout city
- Testing stations at registration points
- Display formations showing results

**Hidden Components:**
- Connection to Ancient Layer
- The Sleeping Formation (power source)
- Enforcement mechanisms (theoretical)
- Wei Zhong's modifications (unknown)

### How It Works

**Official Explanation:**
The Array measures chi flow through standard meridians, calculating potential based on channel width, flow rate, and capacity.

**True Function:**
The Array is incomplete technology from the Ancient civilization. Wei Zhong reconstructed it without full understanding. It measures one dimension of chi (standard flow) while being blind to others (inverse).

**The Possible Enforcement:**
Evidence suggests the Array doesn't just measure—it influences. Being labeled "F-grade" may actually limit growth. The measurement becomes the reality.

### The Flaw

The Array cannot measure:
- Inverse chi (reads as negative/zero)
- Chi quality (only quantity)
- Willpower and determination
- Potential for growth
- Anything the builders didn't intend

### Secrets

**What Wei Zhong Changed:**
Before his death, Wei Zhong entered the Ancient Layer and modified something. His notes suggest:
- He weakened the enforcement function
- He created a kill switch
- He ensured the Inverted One could emerge
- He may have doomed the Array long-term

**The Kill Switch:**
Somewhere in the Ancient Layer, possibly near Wei Zhong's tomb, is a mechanism to disable the Array. The Calibration Initiative has searched for decades. The Beggars Sect protects the secret.

### Narrative Function

**In MVP:**
- Ever-present oppressor
- Source of Li Wei's "F-grade" label
- Target of eventual destruction

**In Sequel:**
- Li Wei seeks kill switch
- Truth about enforcement revealed
- Final confrontation with the system itself

## The Sleeping Formation (沉睡阵)

*"The power that predates power"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Formation (Unknown) |
| Origin | Ancient Layer builders |
| Current Location | The Deep |
| Status | Active (dormant?) |
| Rarity | Unique |

### Description

At the bottom of the Ancient Layer lies a formation so old it predates recorded history. Wei Zhong called it "The Sleeping Formation" because it appeared dormant—but he believed it was merely waiting.

### What We Know

- Powers the Aptitude Array remotely
- Contains chi patterns matching nothing modern
- Responds to inverse chi specifically
- Has never been fully mapped or understood

### What Wei Zhong Wrote

> *"The Sleeping Formation is not asleep. It watches. It waits. It has been waiting since before our ancestors dreamed of chi. I fear what will happen when it decides the waiting is over."*

### Theories

1. **Power Source:** Simply ancient technology providing energy
2. **Controller:** Actually controls the Array, Wei Zhong just activated interface
3. **Entity:** Something alive, or the remnant of something alive
4. **Trap:** Designed to draw in certain souls for unknown purpose
5. **Seed:** Will eventually "bloom" into something else

### Narrative Function

**In MVP:** Mentioned in mysteries, never seen
**In Sequel:** Li Wei eventually descends to confront it

## Calibration Seal (校准封印)

*"The pendant's parent formation"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Formation (Suppression) |
| Origin | Calibration Initiative |
| Current Location | Initiative Complex |
| Status | Active |
| Rarity | Rare (multiple instances) |

### Description

The formation technology that powers Li Wei's jade pendant and similar devices. Developed by the Initiative to suppress inverse chi.

### How It Works

- Creates field that dampens chi flow
- Specifically targets inverse meridians
- Includes tracking and identification
- Can be tuned for different suppression levels

### Variants

| Type | Suppression | Tracking | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Pendant | 80-95% | 1 mile | Li Wei's type |
| Collar | 99% | 10 miles | High-security subjects |
| Chamber | 100% | N/A | Stationary containment |
| Field | 50% | City-wide | Emergency protocols |

### Narrative Function

Li Wei's pendant is a Calibration Seal device, damaged during his escape. Understanding the formation is key to eventually removing or controlling the pendant.

# RELICS AND DEVICES

---

## Li Wei's Jade Pendant (李威的玉佩)

*"The chain that protects and imprisons"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Device (Suppression) |
| Origin | Calibration Initiative |
| Current Location | Li Wei's neck |
| Status | Damaged, functional |
| Rarity | Rare |

### Physical Description

**Appearance:**
A disc of pale green jade, roughly two inches diameter, on a simple cord. Warm to the touch. Inscribed with a twisted spiral symbol—chi flowing backward.

**Hidden Features:**
- Crystal matrix inside jade
- Formation circuits invisible to naked eye
- Resonance chamber for tracking
- Emergency termination trigger (disabled)

### Functions

| Function | Status | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Suppression | 80% (was 95%) | Limits Li Wei's chi output |
| Tracking | Intermittent | Initiative can locate within ~1 mile |
| Identification | Active | Marks Li Wei as Subject 17 |
| Termination | Disabled | Was kill switch |

### Damage Assessment

The explosion during Li Wei's escape damaged the pendant:
- Suppression reduced (growth possible)
- Tracking unreliable (can hide)
- Termination offline (can't be killed remotely)
- Core function intact (still suppresses)

### The Dilemma

**Keeping It:**
- Hides his full power from enemies
- Tracking leads Initiative to him
- Limits his potential
- Safety net (without it, control is harder)

**Removing It:**
- Full power access
- No tracking
- Risk of uncontrolled chi explosion
- May not survive the release

### Narrative Function

**Visual Reminder:** Always present, always mysterious
**Power Limiter:** Explains gradual growth
**Ticking Clock:** Initiative can find him
**Eventual Choice:** Remove, embrace, or transcend

## The Beggar's Pine Seed (丐帮松种)

*"Life that refuses to die"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Relic (Natural/Chi-infused) |
| Origin | Unknown (pre-founding) |
| Current Location | Beggar's Corner |
| Status | Growing |
| Rarity | Unique |

### Description

The ancient tree in Beggar's Corner shouldn't exist. Pine trees don't grow in enclosed urban spaces without light. Yet the Beggar's Pine has thrived for centuries.

### Properties

- Grows without adequate sunlight
- Survives extreme conditions
- Chi signature is inverse-aligned
- Cloth strips tied to it seem to preserve
- Members report feeling peace near it

### The Secret

The Beggar's Pine grew from a seed brought from the Ancient Layer by the sect founder. It's connected to the same energy source as the Sleeping Formation—but aligned to inverse chi. It's essentially a living inverse chi formation.

### Powers

- Area of inverse chi concentration
- Preserves offerings (cloth strips don't rot)
- Rumored to grant visions during meditation
- May communicate with those of sufficient inverse cultivation

### Narrative Function

**Symbol:** The sect's heart and soul
**Mystery:** What is it really?
**Connection:** Links sect to Ancient Layer

## Wei Zhong's Journals (韦忠的日记)

*"The confession of the system's creator"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Relic (Documents) |
| Origin | Wei Zhong |
| Current Location | Various (scattered) |
| Status | Partial |
| Rarity | Extremely rare |

### Description

Wei Zhong's personal journals documenting his discovery, creation, regret, and final actions regarding the Aptitude Array.

### Known Locations

| Volume | Location | Content |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Discovery | Ancient Layer | Finding the Array fragments |
| Creation | Spire Archives (sealed) | Building the Array |
| Doubt | Beggars Sect Archive | Discovering the flaw |
| Regret | Hollow One's possession | Attempting to fix it |
| Final | Wei Zhong's Tomb | What he actually did |

### Significant Passages

**From "Discovery":**
> *"The formations in the Ancient Layer are beyond anything I've seen. They measure chi in ways we've never conceived. I believe I can reconstruct them."*

**From "Doubt":**
> *"Subject showed impossible readings—chi flowing backward. The Array registered nothing. It's not measuring everything. What else does it miss?"*

**From "Regret":**
> *"I have created a prison and called it order. I have measured one truth and called it all truth. I have given the powerful a tool of oppression disguised as fairness."*

**From "Final" (allegedly):**
> *"I cannot destroy what I have made. But I can weaken it. I can ensure that one day, one will emerge who can finish what I could not. The staff waits. The prophecy will fulfill. My sin may yet become salvation."*

### Narrative Function

**In MVP:** Referenced, fragments found
**In Sequel:** Complete picture assembled, guides Li Wei's mission

## Initiative Subject Files (校准对象档案)

*"The records of the disappeared"*

### Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Documents |
| Origin | Calibration Initiative |
| Current Location | Initiative Complex |
| Status | Classified |
| Rarity | N/A |

### Description

Complete records of all 23 subjects collected by the Calibration Initiative over 60 years.

### Contents

Each file contains:
- Original aptitude test results
- Anomaly flag details
- Family information (for "acquisition")
- Test protocols applied
- Results and observations
- Cause of death (for 22 of 23)

### Significant Subjects

| Subject | Year | Anomaly | Fate |

| 12 | 120 | Pendant prototype test | Survived 3 years |
| 17 | 128 | Li Wei | Escaped |
| 23 | 145 | Current subject | Still held |

### The Secret

**Subject 23** exists—another child with inverse potential, collected two years ago. The Initiative is trying to create a "controllable" version of what Li Wei became. This child could be ally or weapon in the sequel.

### Narrative Function

**In MVP:** Li Wei's file referenced in flashbacks
**In Sequel:** Discovery of Subject 23, rescue mission

# LOST AND LEGENDARY

---

## The Array Kill Switch

*"Wei Zhong's final gift"*

### Status: Unconfirmed

According to Wei Zhong's journals, he created a mechanism to disable the Aptitude Array completely. Location unknown—possibly near his tomb in the Ancient Layer, possibly hidden elsewhere.

### What We Know

- Wei Zhong believed the Array couldn't be destroyed directly
- He created an alternative: disconnection from power source
- The mechanism requires inverse chi to activate
- "Only one who flows backward can reach it"

### Search Efforts

The Calibration Initiative has searched for decades. They've mapped portions of the Ancient Layer but never found the switch. The Beggars Sect may know more than they reveal.

---

## The Founder's Begging Bowl

*"The first empty vessel"*

### Status: Lost

The Beggars Sect founder allegedly possessed a bowl that could hold infinite chi. It disappeared during the Redistribution persecution.

### Legend

- Bowl was Ancient Layer artifact
- Could store and release chi without loss
- Symbol of "emptiness contains everything"
- May still exist somewhere in the Undercity

### Truth (If Any)

Unknown. May be pure legend. May be waiting to be found.

---

## The Mirror of True Reflection

*"The glass that shows what you are"*

### Status: Myth

A legendary artifact supposedly created by the Ancient Layer civilization that shows a person's true aptitude—not what the Array measures, but what they actually are.

### Legend

- Anyone who looks sees their true potential
- Drove some mad (saw themselves as nothing)
- Gave others hope (saw themselves as everything)
- Allegedly destroyed by High Sects during Redistribution

### Truth (If Any)

If the Mirror existed, it was proof the Array was incomplete. Its destruction would have been priority one for those in power.

---

## The Inverse Meridian Map

*"The body's hidden pathways"*

### Status: Fragments

A complete chart of inverse meridians—the "garbage pathways" that standard cultivation ignores. The Beggars Sect founder allegedly created it; only fragments survive.

### What's Known

- Maps approximately 60% of inverse pathways
- Remaining 40% theorized but unconfirmed
- Complete map would revolutionize inverse cultivation
- May exist complete in Ancient Layer records

### Narrative Function

Li Wei's journey partially involves mapping his own inverse system, potentially completing what the founder started.

# ARTIFACT INTERACTION RULES

---

## Chi Compatibility

| Artifact | Standard Chi | Inverse Chi |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Dog Beating Staff | Rejection/pain | Acceptance/power |
| Aptitude Array | Full function | Cannot measure |
| Jade Pendant | Full suppression | Partial suppression |
| Sleeping Formation | Limited interaction | Full interaction |
| Beggar's Pine | Normal plant | Living formation |

---

## Power Scaling

Artifacts in Martial Arts Haven follow rules:

1. **Ancient > Modern:** Ancient Layer artifacts exceed anything created since
2. **Inverse Alignment:** Inverse-compatible artifacts often more powerful
3. **Wielder Matters:** Artifacts scale with user's cultivation
4. **Intent Counts:** Many artifacts respond to purpose, not just chi
5. **Connection Required:** True power requires bond, not just possession

---

## Finding Artifacts

**Where to Look:**
- Ancient Layer (most powerful, most dangerous)
- Sect vaults (guarded but known)
- Undercity ruins (hidden, forgotten)
- Private collections (requires infiltration)
- Legend locations (may not exist)

**How to Claim:**
- Combat (take from current wielder)
- Inheritance (sect succession)
- Discovery (find the lost)
- Creation (extremely rare)
- Gift (from those who have)
