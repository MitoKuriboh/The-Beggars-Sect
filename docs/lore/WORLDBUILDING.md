## The World at a Glance

**Setting Name:** Martial Arts Haven (武林天堂)
**Era:** Post-Redistribution (Year 147 of the New Order)
**Tone:** Urban wuxia noir meets cyberpunk social stratification
**Core Theme:** What defines a person's worth—their born potential or their chosen path?

## The Fundamental Truth: Aptitude

### What Is Aptitude?

Aptitude is the innate capacity for martial cultivation that every person is born with. It is:

- **Invisible** - Cannot be seen, only measured through special methods
- **Immutable** - Cannot be changed, trained, or transferred
- **Inherited** - Partially genetic, partially cosmic chance
- **The basis of all social order**

### The Aptitude Scale

| Grade | Name | Population % | Typical Role |
|-------|------|--------------|--------------|
| S | Transcendent | 0.001% | Legends, hidden masters |
| A | Prodigy | 0.1% | Sect leaders, generals |
| B | Gifted | 2% | Elite warriors, officers |
| C | Capable | 15% | Soldiers, skilled workers |
| D | Common | 50% | Laborers, citizens |
| E | Limited | 25% | Servants, low workers |
| F | Negligible | 7.9% | Beggars, untouchables |

### How Aptitude Manifests

**High Aptitude (A-S):**
- Techniques feel natural, like remembering rather than learning
- Chi flows abundantly, recovery is rapid
- Body adapts quickly to training stress
- Can perceive others' killing intent
- May experience "martial enlightenment" spontaneously

**Medium Aptitude (B-C):**
- Can learn techniques with dedicated practice
- Chi must be carefully cultivated
- Progress is steady but requires discipline
- Can become genuinely powerful through effort

**Low Aptitude (D-E):**
- Techniques require immense repetition
- Chi capacity is limited
- Progress plateaus early
- Can become competent but rarely exceptional

**Negligible Aptitude (F):**
- Conventional wisdom says they cannot learn martial arts
- Chi pathways are "closed" or "inverted"
- Society considers them worthless for combat
- **But the Beggars Sect knows a secret...**

### The Beggars' Secret

The sect discovered generations ago that F-grade aptitude isn't "broken"—it's *different*. Their chi doesn't flow through standard meridians. It flows through desperation, hunger, and survival instinct.

A starving beggar fighting for their life can access power that measured aptitude cannot predict. The Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms and the Dog Beating Staff were created specifically to harness this "inverse chi."

**This is why Li Wei, despite appearing to have F-grade aptitude, learns so quickly. His aptitude isn't low—it's unmeasurable by conventional means.**

## The Redistribution: History's Wound

### Before (The Old World)

For millennia, martial arts sects ruled through strength. The strong dominated, the weak served. Bloodlines hoarded techniques. Wars between sects killed millions.

There was no measurement of aptitude—only results. Anyone could try to learn. Many died attempting techniques beyond their capacity. But some low-born individuals rose to greatness through sheer will.

### The Catalyst (Year 0)

A scholar named **Wei Zhong** invented the Aptitude Measuring Array—a formation that could precisely determine a person's martial potential at birth.

He believed this would bring peace. If everyone knew their place, there would be no pointless deaths from overreaching. Society could be *optimized*.

### The Redistribution (Years 1-20)

The great sects, seeing opportunity, embraced the Array. Within a generation:

- Children were tested at birth
- Low-aptitude individuals were forbidden from learning martial arts
- "For their own safety"
- High-aptitude children were taken from low-aptitude parents
- "To maximize their potential"
- Technique manuals were locked away from the unworthy
- Social castes calcified around aptitude grades

### The Resistance (Years 20-50)

Some refused. The Beggars Sect, always outsiders, became the sanctuary for those who rejected the new order. They:

- Accepted anyone regardless of aptitude
- Developed techniques specifically for "low" aptitude users
- Preserved the old way: anyone can learn, anyone can rise
- Were hunted, scattered, driven underground

### The Current Era (Year 147)

The world has known nothing but the Aptitude System for over a century. Most accept it as natural law. The idea that a low-aptitude person could become a master is considered:

- Scientifically impossible
- Socially dangerous
- Practically heretical

The Beggars Sect survives in shadows, a whispered legend. Most believe they're just beggars who pretend to know martial arts—harmless madmen clinging to fantasy.

**They are wrong.**

## The City: Haven's Cradle

The game takes place in **Haven's Cradle**, one of the great cities of Martial Arts Haven.

### City Overview

Haven's Cradle is built in concentric rings around the **Measuring Spire**—the original location where Wei Zhong invented the Aptitude Array.

**Population:** ~3 million
**Governance:** Council of High Sects (A and B grade dominated)
**Economy:** Martial service, technique trade, cultivation resources

### The Rings

#### The Spire District (Center)
- The Measuring Spire itself
- High Sect headquarters
- Where S and A grade individuals live
- Gleaming towers, pristine streets
- Commoners need permits to enter

#### The Garrison Ring
- Spartan headquarters and barracks
- Military academies
- B and C grade residents
- Orderly, disciplined, clean
- Heavy martial presence

#### The Commerce Ring
- Markets, shops, businesses
- Mixed population (C, D, E grades)
- Where most "normal" life happens
- Bustling, crowded, alive

#### The Labor Ring
- Factories, workshops, warehouses
- D and E grade workers
- Functional but worn
- Where things are made

#### The Outer Ring (Lower Streets)
- F grade and unregistered individuals
- Beggars, criminals, refugees
- Minimal law enforcement
- Where our story begins
- **The Beggars Sect operates here**

---

## The Factions

### The High Sects (Background)

The ruling powers of Haven's Cradle. They control:
- Aptitude testing
- Technique distribution
- Military force
- Political power

They don't appear directly in the MVP but their shadow looms over everything.

### The Spartans

**Philosophy:** Order through discipline. Peace through control.

The Spartans are the military arm of the established order. They:
- Enforce aptitude-based laws
- Patrol the middle and upper rings
- Investigate "unauthorized martial activity"
- Believe they're protecting society

**They are not evil.** Many Spartans genuinely believe the system protects people. Commander Vex is an honorable man enforcing what he sees as just laws.

**Internal Conflict:** Some Spartans quietly question why they hunt beggars. The Order wasn't always this rigid. Older members remember when the goal was protecting the weak, not oppressing them.

### The Urban Thugs

**Philosophy:** Strength takes. Weakness gives.

The gangs of the Lower Streets are what happens when you tell people they're worthless: some become worthless. They:
- Prey on their fellow low-aptitude citizens
- Fight for territory and scraps
- Worship strength without discipline
- Are both victims and victimizers

**Razor** rose from nothing through pure brutality. He hates the beggars because they represent something he can't accept: that there might be another way. If the beggars can find dignity, what does that say about what he's become?

### The Beggars Sect

**Philosophy:** Hunger is strength. Nothing is everything. The empty bowl holds the universe.

The sect is built on paradoxes:
- Power through poverty
- Strength through weakness
- Community through solitude
- Mastery through begging

**Structure:** Loose and non-hierarchical. "Elders" are respected for wisdom, not commanded by rank. Any beggar can refuse any order. The sect holds together through shared philosophy, not authority.

**Secret History:** The sect was once a great power—the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms were feared across the land. After the Redistribution, they chose to fade rather than fight. They're waiting. For what? Perhaps for someone like Li Wei.

### The Lone Wolves

**Philosophy:** Individual. Beyond faction. Seeking something.

Lone Wolves are martial artists who've rejected all affiliation. They:
- Wander seeking challenge or enlightenment
- Follow no rules but their own
- May be former sect members, exiles, or born outsiders
- Range from honorable ronin to dangerous predators

**The Hollow One** is the ultimate Lone Wolf—someone who mastered everything, found it empty, and now seeks the one thing that might give meaning: a worthy opponent or student.

## Martial Arts: The Chi System

### What Is Chi?

Chi (气) is life energy that flows through all living things. In martial artists, it can be:
- Cultivated (increased through training)
- Channeled (directed through techniques)
- Projected (used for attacks beyond physical reach)
- Sensed (feeling others' power and intent)

### Chi and Aptitude

Aptitude determines:
- **Chi Capacity** - How much chi you can hold
- **Chi Flow** - How efficiently it moves through your body
- **Chi Recovery** - How quickly it replenishes
- **Chi Affinity** - What types of techniques suit you

High aptitude = wider, smoother chi pathways = easier cultivation.

### The Beggar's Inverse Chi

Standard chi flows through the Eight Extraordinary Meridians in predictable patterns. Beggar chi flows through what cultivators call "garbage meridians"—pathways considered vestigial or blocked.

These pathways activate under:
- Extreme hunger
- Life-threatening danger
- Desperate need
- Emotional intensity

This makes Beggar techniques:
- Impossible to predict (enemies can't sense standard chi flow)
- Fueled by adversity (stronger when wounded, hungry, cornered)
- Fundamentally different from "proper" martial arts

---

## The Techniques: Philosophy

### Standard Sect Techniques

Most martial arts follow a structure:
1. Foundation forms (build chi pathways)
2. Basic techniques (simple applications)
3. Advanced techniques (complex combinations)
4. Master techniques (signature moves)
5. Ultimate techniques (life's work)

Progress is linear. Higher aptitude = faster progress.

### Beggar Techniques

The Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms follow a different philosophy:

1. **No foundation** - Start from zero, always
2. **Situational awakening** - Techniques emerge from need
3. **Mastery through use** - Understanding comes from doing
4. **Inverse scaling** - Worse conditions = stronger techniques

The Dog Beating Staff is even stranger:
- Can only be wielded by the truly destitute
- Grows stronger as the user owns less
- Ultimate form requires "owning nothing, not even yourself"

### Why Palm Techniques?

Beggars have no weapons. Their body is their only resource. Palm techniques represent:
- Fighting with what you have
- The human touch (begging requires reaching out)
- Openness (palm open vs. fist closed)
- Receiving and giving (palm up to receive alms, palm out to give help)

## The Questions the Story Asks

### Surface Level
- Can Li Wei master the Beggar techniques?
- Can he defeat the threats facing the sect?
- What is his mysterious past?

### Deeper Level
- What makes a person valuable?
- Is the Aptitude system just?
- Can individuals change unjust systems?
- What do we owe each other?

### Deepest Level
- If your "potential" is predetermined, do your choices matter?
- Can someone born "worthless" become worthy?
- Is there strength in accepting weakness?
- What does it mean to be empty—and is emptiness freedom?

## Narrative Rules

### The World Feels Unfair Because It Is

Don't soften the injustice. The aptitude system is:
- Genuinely believed by most people
- Enforced with real consequences
- Internalized by its victims
- Comfortable for its beneficiaries

### Enemies Are People

- Razor is cruel because the world was cruel to him first
- Commander Vex enforces unjust laws while being personally honorable
- The Hollow One is empty because mastery brought no meaning
- Even Street Punks are someone's child

### Hope Is Hard-Won

The beggars' philosophy isn't easy optimism. It's:
- Finding strength in suffering
- Community in isolation
- Meaning in meaninglessness
- Earned through struggle, not given

### Mystery Has Answers

Li Wei's past will be revealed. The hints will pay off. But:
- Not in this game (cliffhanger ending)
- The mystery serves the theme (identity, worth, choice)
- When revealed, it should recontextualize everything

## What This Means for Mechanics

Based on this worldbuilding, the mechanics should:

1. **Emphasize desperation** - Li Wei should be stronger at low HP, not weaker
2. **Reward hunger** - The Hungry stance should feel powerful, not just risky
3. **Make defense meaningful** - Weathered stance = enduring hardship
4. **Flow should feel natural** - Flowing stance = beggar adaptability
5. **Mastery through use** - Not grinding, but learning by doing
6. **Chi generation from adversity** - Getting hit = more chi
