**Version:** 2.0

## Introduction

Four major factions and numerous minor players shape Haven's Cradle. This document focuses on the political entities that interact with Li Wei's story—their structures, key figures, internal conflicts, and hidden agendas.

**Note:** For martial arts sects specifically, see SECTS.md. This document covers factions as political entities.

---

## THE BEGGARS SECT (丐幫)

*"The empty bowl holds the universe."*

### Overview

The oldest and most mysterious martial organization in existence. Driven underground 147 years ago, they survive in shadows, preserve forbidden knowledge, and await prophecy.

**Public Perception:** Crazy beggars who pretend to know martial arts
**Reality:** Masters of inverse chi, keepers of ancient secrets, the only true opposition to the Aptitude System

### Structure

**Leadership:**
Unlike other sects, the Beggars have no single leader:
- Council of Elders makes decisions by consensus
- Last official Sect Chief died in Year 45
- The Dog Beating Staff sits unclaimed, waiting
- Anyone can refuse any request

**Ranks:**

| Rank | Symbol | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Beggar | 0 burdens | Learning philosophy |
| Brother/Sister | 1-3 burdens | Accepted member |
| Palm Brother/Sister | 4-6 burdens | Combat trained |
| Elder | 7-9 burdens | Master, teacher |
| Chief (vacant) | Dog Beating Staff | Supreme leader |

**The Burden System:**
Cloth bags tied to robes represent responsibility. More burdens = more the sect relies on you. Elders carry nine. New members carry none. Li Wei starts with zero.

### Key Figures

#### Elder Chen (陳長老)

**Role:** Flowing Stance Master, Li Wei's primary mentor
**Age:** 63
**Aptitude:** F-grade (standard), Unknown (inverse)
**Philosophy:** Pragmatist—believes the sect must adapt to survive

**Personality:**
- Warm, patient, genuinely caring
- Sees potential others miss
- Willing to bend rules for results
- Carries grief for lost students

**Background:**
Chen was a merchant's son who tested F-grade at age 5. His family abandoned him. He wandered until Old Dao found him at age 12. He's been with the sect for 51 years and has trained more students than any living Elder.

**Secret:**
Chen recognized Li Wei's pendant immediately—he saw it once before, 40 years ago, on a girl the Initiative took. He's never spoken of this. He believes Li Wei may be her son.

**Role in Story:**
Li Wei's guide and protector. Teaches Flowing Stance. Represents hope and patient wisdom.

---

#### Elder Wu (武長老)

**Role:** Weathered Stance Master, harsh trainer
**Age:** 58
**Aptitude:** F-grade (standard), High (inverse)
**Philosophy:** Purist—traditions must be preserved exactly

**Personality:**
- Cold, demanding, seemingly cruel
- Pushes students beyond their limits
- Respects only demonstrated ability
- Secretly cares deeply

**Background:**
Wu was born in the sect—her parents were both members. She never knew any other life. She's seen students fail, die, or betray. Her harshness comes from wanting them to survive.

**Secret:**
Wu has a daughter who left the sect and now lives as a servant in the Commerce Ring. They haven't spoken in 15 years. Wu watches her from a distance sometimes.

**Role in Story:**
The obstacle that becomes ally. Teaches Weathered Stance. Represents endurance and tough love.

---

#### Elder Mei (梅長老)

**Role:** Hungry Stance Master, chaotic teacher
**Age:** 44
**Aptitude:** F-grade (standard), Extreme (inverse)
**Philosophy:** Neither pragmatist nor purist—follows instinct

**Personality:**
- Unpredictable, intense, sometimes frightening
- Teaches through experience not explanation
- Laughs at danger
- Most powerful combat Elder

**Background:**
Mei wasn't born a beggar—she was a soldier who killed her commanding officer for ordering a massacre. She fled, starved, and discovered her inverse chi activated by desperation. The sect found her half-dead and half-enlightened.

**Secret:**
Mei's commanding officer survived. He's now a Spartan Captain. She knows. She's waiting for the right moment.

**Role in Story:**
The wild card. Teaches Hungry Stance. Represents the power of embracing chaos.

---

#### Old Dao (老道)

**Role:** Mysterious guide, appears and disappears
**Age:** Unknown (appears 70+)
**Aptitude:** Unmeasurable
**Philosophy:** Unknown

**Personality:**
- Speaks in riddles that turn out to be literal
- Appears when needed, vanishes when not
- Knows things he shouldn't
- Treats Li Wei with strange familiarity

**Background:**
No one knows where Old Dao came from. He appeared around Year 75 and hasn't aged since. He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep that anyone's seen, and enters places without using doors.

**Secret:**
Old Dao is connected to the Ancient Layer. He may have been there—or may still be there somehow. His human form might be a projection or remnant of something older.

**Role in Story:**
The guide who knows more than he says. Found Li Wei first. Represents mystery and destiny.

---

#### Brother Feng (馮師兄)

**Role:** Li Wei's peer, sparring partner
**Age:** 21
**Aptitude:** F-grade (standard), Moderate (inverse)
**Philosophy:** Uncertain—still finding his way

**Personality:**
- Friendly, competitive, slightly jealous
- Wants to be special but fears he isn't
- Loyal to the sect
- Struggles with self-doubt

**Background:**
Feng has been with the sect since childhood. He's competent but not exceptional. Li Wei's rapid progress makes him question his own worth—the same poison the Aptitude System spreads.

**Secret:**
Feng is tempted by gang offers. They've promised him importance. He hasn't acted on it—yet.

**Role in Story:**
The friend who might become enemy. Represents the system's damage to self-worth.

---

### Internal Politics

**The Great Debate:**

*Emergence vs. Concealment*

For decades, Elders have argued:
- **Emergence faction** (led by Chen): The prophecy approaches. We must prepare to act openly. Hiding forever means dying forgotten.
- **Concealment faction** (led by Wu): Every emergence has led to massacre. We survive by staying hidden. Patience, not action.

Li Wei's arrival forces the decision. If he's the Inverted One, hiding is no longer possible.

**The Prophecy Conflict:**

Not all Elders agree on interpretation:
- Some believe the Inverted One will restore the sect to glory
- Some believe the Inverted One will destroy the Aptitude System
- Some believe the prophecy is metaphor, not prediction
- Old Dao says nothing, which concerns everyone

---

### Resources and Capabilities

**Strengths:**
- Inverse chi techniques (unpredictable, powerful)
- Intelligence network (beggars hear everything)
- Hidden locations throughout city
- Philosophy that turns weakness into strength
- Ancient knowledge others have lost

**Weaknesses:**
- Small numbers (~200 in Haven's Cradle)
- No political power
- Constantly hunted
- Resource scarcity
- Internal disagreements

---

## THE SPARTANS (斯巴達衛)

*"Order through discipline. Peace through control."*

### Overview

The military arm of Haven's Cradle's ruling structure. They enforce aptitude-based laws, maintain order, and believe they're protecting society.

**Public Perception:** Noble protectors, stern but fair
**Reality:** Enforcers of an unjust system, some questioning, most not

### Structure

**Command Hierarchy:**

| Rank | Number | Authority |
|------|--------|-----------|
| High Commander | 1 | Reports to High Sects |
| Commander | 5 | District authority |
| Captain | 25 | Company command |
| Lieutenant | 100 | Platoon command |
| Sergeant | 500 | Squad leader |
| Warrior | 2,000 | Combat specialist |
| Soldier | 5,000 | Basic certified |
| Recruit | Variable | In training |

**Units:**
- **The Watch** - Patrol and peacekeeping
- **The Hunt** - Tracking unauthorized martial artists
- **The Guard** - High Sect protection
- **The Academy** - Training new recruits

### Key Figures

#### High Commander Zhao (趙大將軍)

**Role:** Supreme Spartan authority
**Age:** 71
**Aptitude:** A-grade
**Sect:** Iron Mountain (affiliate)

**Personality:**
- Cold, calculating, political
- Believes absolutely in hierarchy
- Sees Spartans as his personal army
- Ambitious even at his age

**Background:**
Zhao has commanded for 35 years. He's survived every political shift by being useful to whoever holds power. He doesn't believe in the Aptitude System—he believes in control.

**Secret:**
Zhao knows about the Calibration Initiative and has been feeding them resources. He sees inverse chi as a weapon to be controlled, not destroyed.

**Role in Story:**
The true enemy behind Vex. Represents corruption of authority.

---

#### Commander Vex (維克斯指揮官)

**Role:** Chapter 2 boss, conflicted enforcer
**Age:** 42
**Aptitude:** A-grade
**Sect:** Iron Mountain (raised in)

**Personality:**
- Honorable, intelligent, conflicted
- Follows orders but questions them
- Genuinely wants to protect people
- Struggling with cognitive dissonance

**Background:**
Born to a Spartan family, tested A-grade, rose through merit and discipline. He's never known anything but the system. But he keeps a journal of anomalies—F-grades who demonstrated impossible ability. The evidence is breaking his certainty.

**Secret:**
Vex's younger brother tested F-grade and was taken by the Initiative. Vex was told he died of cultivation sickness. He suspects the truth but fears confirming it.

**Role in Story:**
The enemy who might become ally. Represents honorable people trapped in unjust systems.

---

#### Captain Liu (劉隊長)

**Role:** Hunt unit commander, dedicated hunter
**Age:** 38
**Aptitude:** B-grade
**Sect:** None (career military)

**Personality:**
- Ruthless, efficient, enjoys the hunt
- True believer in Aptitude System
- Sees beggars as subhuman
- No internal conflict

**Background:**
Liu grew up poor in the Labor Ring and clawed his way to B-grade respect through Spartan service. He hates those who remind him of what he escaped. He particularly hates beggars because they represent his fear of falling.

**Secret:**
Liu's mother was F-grade. He's never told anyone. He had her records altered years ago.

**Role in Story:**
The relentless hunter. Represents internalized oppression.

---

#### Sergeant Yun (雲班長)

**Role:** Street-level enforcer, potential ally
**Age:** 29
**Aptitude:** C-grade
**Sect:** None

**Personality:**
- Young, idealistic, not yet hardened
- Joined to help people
- Increasingly disturbed by orders
- Good person in bad position

**Background:**
Yun believed the recruitment propaganda about protecting the weak. Five years of service have shown her the reality. She's seen beggars who threatened no one arrested. She's seen F-grade children separated from families. She doesn't know what to do with her doubt.

**Secret:**
Yun has been leaving food for Lower Street families. If discovered, she'd be discharged—or worse.

**Role in Story:**
The good soldier questioning orders. Represents potential for internal reform.

---

### Internal Politics

**The Schism (Quiet):**

Not official, not organized, but real:
- **Loyalists:** The system works. Obey orders. Don't question.
- **Reformers:** Something is wrong. We should protect, not oppress.
- **Opportunists:** Follow whoever wins.

Vex leads the reformers without knowing it. His journal is becoming a manifesto passed in whispers.

**The Original Oath:**

The Spartans' founding oath was: "We stand between the people and the darkness."

Current oath is: "We maintain order through strength."

Some older members remember. The change happened gradually. Most don't notice the difference.

---

### Resources and Capabilities

**Strengths:**
- Numbers (~8,000 in Haven's Cradle)
- Training and discipline
- Legal authority
- Resources and equipment
- High Sect backing

**Weaknesses:**
- Internal dissent (hidden)
- Bound by rules and politics
- Not trained for inverse chi
- Leadership corruption
- Growing doubt

---

## THE URBAN THUGS

*"Strength takes. Weakness gives."*

### Overview

The gangs of the Lower Streets—both victims and victimizers. They're what happens when society discards people: some become predators.

**Public Perception:** Criminal scum, dangerous animals
**Reality:** Complex ecosystem of survival, trauma, and choices

### Structure

**Hierarchy (Under Razor):**

| Rank | Count | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Razor | 1 | Absolute leader |
| Lieutenant | 5 | Block commanders |
| Enforcer | 25 | Trusted fighters |
| Brawler | 100 | Proven members |
| Punk | 200+ | New, expendable |

**Territories:**
The Outer Ring is divided into blocks. Lieutenants control blocks. Boundaries are marked and (mostly) respected.

### Key Figures

#### Razor (剃刀)

**Real Name:** Li Xing (李星)
**Role:** Gang supreme, Chapter 1 boss
**Age:** 29
**Aptitude:** F-grade (standard), High (inverse—unknown to him)

**Personality:**
- Brutal, intelligent, charismatic
- Hides depth behind savagery
- Hates weakness (in himself most)
- Secretly questioning everything

**Background:**
At seven, his parents were killed by a rival gang. He joined gangs to survive. At fourteen, he killed his first man in self-defense. At seventeen, he realized he could lead. Now he rules through fear—and wonders what else he could have been.

**Secret:**
Razor taught himself to read. He writes poetry. He has a locked room full of books. His intelligence terrifies him because it shows him what his choices cost.

**Hidden Ability:**
Razor has inverse chi but doesn't know it. His impossible fighting ability (F-grade who beats C-grades) comes from it. The Beggars Sect has noticed. They're watching.

**Role in Story:**
First major enemy. Represents what Li Wei could become without guidance.

---

#### Scarred Jin (疤臉金)

**Role:** Razor's second, brutal enforcer
**Age:** 34
**Aptitude:** E-grade

**Personality:**
- Vicious, loyal, simple
- Does whatever Razor says
- Enjoys violence
- No internal conflict

**Background:**
Jin was born in the gangs. He's never known anything else. He's not intelligent enough to question. Razor values his loyalty and usefulness.

**Secret:**
Jin is terrified of Razor. His loyalty comes from fear, not love. If Razor falls, Jin would flip instantly.

**Role in Story:**
Razor's weapon. Represents unthinking brutality.

---

#### Little Mei (小梅)

**Role:** Gang recruiter, unexpected depth
**Age:** 22
**Aptitude:** F-grade

**Personality:**
- Manipulative, pragmatic, survivor
- Recruits desperate people for the gang
- More intelligent than she shows
- Hates what she does

**Background:**
Mei was a victim before she was a predator. She learned early that crying doesn't help. Now she brings others into the gang—it's that or be prey herself.

**Secret:**
Mei has been secretly helping some recruits escape to the Beggars Sect. She doesn't know why. Maybe she's trying to balance scales that can't be balanced.

**Role in Story:**
The humanized enemy. Represents cycles of victimization.

---

### Internal Politics

**Post-Razor:**

If Li Wei defeats Razor in Chapter 1, the gang doesn't disappear:
- Lieutenants will fight for succession
- Jin might take temporary control
- The chaos could be opportunity or disaster
- Some members might seek different paths

**The Beggars Question:**

Some gang members notice:
- Beggars survive without predation
- The Sect offers something different
- There might be another way

These members sometimes disappear. They joined the Sect. This terrifies Razor because it undermines his worldview.

---

## THE CALIBRATION INITIATIVE

*"Understand. Control. Optimize."*

### Overview

A secret program jointly run by Silent River Sect and the High Sects. They study aptitude anomalies—people the Array can't properly measure. Their goal: understand inverse chi and either eliminate it or weaponize it.

**Public Perception:** Doesn't exist
**Reality:** Has operated for 60 years, taken dozens of children, killed most of them

### Structure

**Command:**
- **Director Shen** - Overall command, reports to Silent River
- **Research Lead** - Scientific direction
- **Operations Lead** - Field work, subject acquisition

**Divisions:**
- **Acquisition** - Finding and taking anomalies
- **Research** - Testing and analysis
- **Containment** - Keeping subjects controlled
- **Disposal** - Eliminating failures and witnesses

### Key Figures

#### Director Shen (沈主任)

**Role:** Initiative head, true antagonist
**Age:** 56
**Aptitude:** A-grade
**Sect:** Silent River

**Personality:**
- Cold, methodical, utterly amoral
- Sees people as data points
- Believes knowledge justifies anything
- No capacity for empathy

**Background:**
Shen was identified young as exceptional in analysis. He rose through Silent River by seeing patterns others missed. He doesn't care about the Aptitude System—he cares about understanding. Everything else is collateral.

**Secret:**
Shen knows the Array is flawed. He's known for years. He doesn't care about fixing it—he cares about controlling what it can't measure.

**Role in Story:**
The mastermind. Represents cold rationality without morality.

---

#### Dr. Mae (梅醫生)

**Role:** Kind researcher, helped Li Wei escape
**Age:** 34
**Aptitude:** C-grade
**Sect:** None (civilian researcher)

**Personality:**
- Compassionate, guilty, brave
- The only one who treated Li Wei as human
- Trying to undermine from within
- Afraid but committed

**Background:**
Mae joined the Initiative believing she'd help people. Five years showed her the truth. She couldn't leave—she knew too much. She couldn't stay silent—her conscience wouldn't let her. So she works from within, small acts of mercy when possible.

**Secret:**
Mae has been feeding information to the Beggars Sect through dead drops. She doesn't know who receives it. She hopes someone does.

**Role in Story:**
The inside ally. Represents moral courage in impossible situations.

---

#### Agent Thorn (棘探員)

**Role:** Recovery specialist, hunting Li Wei
**Age:** 31
**Aptitude:** B-grade
**Sect:** Silent River (field operative)

**Personality:**
- Professional, relentless, increasingly uncomfortable
- Does the job without enjoying it
- Following orders she's starting to question
- Competent enough to be dangerous

**Background:**
Thorn was recruited for her tracking skills. She's recovered seven subjects over her career. Most were returned to the facility. Some were disposed of. She tells herself it's necessary. She's running out of belief.

**Secret:**
Thorn let Subject 12 escape three years ago. She filed a false report. No one knows. The guilt follows her.

**Role in Story:**
The competent hunter. Represents those who could be redeemed.

---

### Operations

**Subject History:**

| Subject | Year Acquired | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| 1-10 | 90-110 | All deceased |
| 11-16 | 112-127 | All deceased |
| 17 (Li Wei) | 128 | Escaped |
| 18-23 | 129-146 | In facility |

**Current Situation:**
Li Wei's escape is a crisis. If he talks, the Initiative's existence becomes known. If he masters his ability, he could destroy everything they've built.

**Recovery Priority:**
Finding Li Wei is the Initiative's primary focus. They've mobilized Spartans who don't know the full picture. They're watching the Beggars Sect. They're running out of time.

---

## THE LONE WOLVES

*"The path is walked alone."*

### Overview

Not an organization—a category. Lone Wolves are martial artists who reject all affiliation, wandering in search of something only they understand.

**Public Perception:** Dangerous wanderers
**Reality:** Each unique, from enlightened sages to predatory monsters

### Types

**The Seekers:**
Looking for enlightenment, technique perfection, or meaning. Generally peaceful unless challenged.

**The Wanderers:**
Simply traveling, teaching when moved to, fighting when necessary. Neutral parties.

**The Predators:**
Hunting worthy opponents whether they want to fight or not. Dangerous by nature.

**The Hollow:**
Those who achieved everything and found it empty. The most unpredictable—they may help, harm, or simply watch.

### Key Figure: The Hollow One

**Real Name:** Wei Lin (韋林)
**Role:** Chapter 3 boss, final test
**Age:** Unknown (appears 50s, might be 200)
**Aptitude:** S-grade (standard), None (inverse—cannot access)
**Ancestry:** Direct descendant of Wei Zhong

**Personality:**
- Empty, seeking, patient
- Has transcended normal emotion
- Curious about Li Wei specifically
- Neither good nor evil—beyond such categories

**Background:**
Wei Lin was born with perfect aptitude. They mastered every technique they encountered by age 30. And felt nothing. Achievement without struggle has no meaning. They've spent decades seeking something that would make them feel.

**Secret:**
Wei Lin knows everything about the Array—their ancestor created it. They know it's flawed. They know about inverse chi. They're waiting to see if Li Wei can show them something new.

**The Test:**
The Hollow One won't try to kill Li Wei. They want to test him—to see if inverse chi is what they've been seeking. If Li Wei proves worthy, the Hollow One will give him the location of the Dog Beating Staff. If not... the Hollow One will wait for the next candidate.

**Role in Story:**
The final boss who isn't really an enemy. Represents what happens when the system works perfectly—and how empty that can be.

### Key Dynamics

**High Sects → Spartans:** Control through command structure
**High Sects → Initiative:** Secret funding and authority
**Spartans → Thugs:** Tolerate as useful chaos containment
**Spartans → Beggars:** Hunt as unauthorized martial artists
**Initiative → Li Wei:** Priority recovery target
**Thugs ↔ Beggars:** Conflict over Lower Streets
**Lone Wolves:** Outside all systems, watching

---

## THE HIDDEN WAR

### Current Situation (Year 147)

**The Initiative** is in crisis mode:
- Li Wei escaped
- Subject 17 was their best result
- If he talks, exposure follows
- If he grows stronger, threat increases

**The Spartans** are being used:
- Vex receives mysterious priority orders
- Hunt units are mobilized
- Most don't know why

**The Beggars** sense change:
- Li Wei's arrival matches prophecy
- Elders debate response
- Old Dao is unusually present

**The Lone Wolves** are gathering:
- Rumors spread among wanderers
- Something significant approaches
- The Hollow One moves for first time in years

### What's Coming

Chapter by chapter escalation:
1. **Chapter 1:** Gang conflict, Li Wei proves himself
2. **Chapter 2:** Spartan attention, Initiative involvement
3. **Chapter 3:** All factions converge, truth revealed

The hidden war becomes visible.
