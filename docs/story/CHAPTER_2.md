## Chapter Summary

Word of Li Wei's victory over Razor reaches the Spartans. Commander Vex, a disciplined officer enforcing unjust laws, investigates reports of "unauthorized martial activity" in the Lower Streets. Li Wei must balance advanced training with Elder Mei (Hungry techniques) while evading Spartan patrols. As the investigation intensifies, Li Wei begins experiencing flashbacks to his past—sterile rooms, numbered subjects, the Spire. The chapter culminates in a confrontation with Commander Vex, whose defeat raises questions that hint at a larger conspiracy.

**Type:** Cutscene (Dream Sequence)
**Location:** Training Ground → Dream
**Player Input:** None

### Purpose
- Show time has passed since Chapter 1
- Plant more mystery seeds
- Transition from triumph to new threat

### Script

```
[FADE IN - Night at Training Ground]

[Li Wei meditates in the courtyard. The jade pendant glows faintly]

NARRATOR TEXT:
Three weeks since Razor's defeat.
Three weeks of training, growing, becoming.
But the dreams haven't stopped.

[DREAM SEQUENCE BEGINS]

[WHITE ROOM - Sterile, clinical]

VOICE: (distant, echoing)
"Subject 17's readings are unprecedented..."

[Li Wei sees himself—younger, in a hospital gown, strapped to a table]

YOUNG LI WEI: [Struggling]
Let me go! I don't want—

MASKED FIGURE: [Leaning in]
What you want is irrelevant. Your chi is... wrong. We need to understand why.

[FLASH - A jade pendant being placed around young Li Wei's neck]

MASKED FIGURE: This will suppress the anomaly. For now.

[FLASH - The pendant glowing, Li Wei screaming]

[FLASH - An explosion of light, alarms blaring]

VOICE: "He's escaped! Subject 17 has ESCAPED!"

[DREAM ENDS]

[Li Wei wakes with a gasp, drenched in sweat]

LI WEI: [Touching the pendant]
What... what am I?

[Elder Chen approaches from the shadows]

ELDER CHEN: The past speaks loudly in sleep. Are you alright?

LI WEI: I saw... a white room. People in masks. They called me a number. Subject 17.

[Elder Chen's expression becomes grave]

ELDER CHEN: The Calibration Initiative.

LI WEI: You know what it is?

ELDER CHEN: [Carefully]
I know rumors. Whispers of experiments the Spire conducts on those they deem... anomalous.

[He sits beside Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: Whatever they did to you, whatever they wanted from you... you escaped. You're here now. That's what matters.

[Beat]

ELDER CHEN: But I fear your escape did not go unnoticed. The Spartans have been asking questions. About a beggar who defeated a gang boss.

[Li Wei tenses]

ELDER CHEN: They're coming, Li Wei. And we must prepare you.

[FADE TO SCENE 2.2]
```

---

## Scene 2.2: The Hunt Begins

**Type:** Exploration with Tension
**Location:** Gang Territory (now accessible)
**Player Input:** Movement, NPC interaction, stealth elements

### Environment Description

Gang Territory is different now. Razor's defeat has created a power vacuum. Other gangs vie for control. But more worrying: Spartan patrols have begun appearing in areas they normally ignore.

The streets feel watched. Informants lurk on corners. The air crackles with paranoia.

### Interactive Elements

**Spartan Patrol (Must Avoid):**
```
[Two Spartans in polished armor walk a patrol route]

SPARTAN 1: Commander Vex has us checking every vagrant in the district.

SPARTAN 2: For what? They're just beggars.

SPARTAN 1: Word is one of them took down Razor. Barehanded.

SPARTAN 2: [Scoffing]
Impossible. F-grades can't learn martial arts. Everyone knows that.

SPARTAN 1: Tell that to Razor's broken ribs.

[If spotted:]
SPARTAN 1: YOU! Stop right there!

[Chase sequence or combat initiated]
```

**Nervous Gang Member:**
```
[A young thug huddles in a doorway]

THUG: [Seeing Li Wei]
Y-you're the one, aren't you? The beggar who beat Razor?

LI WEI: What of it?

THUG: [Looking around]
The Spartans are asking about you. Offering coin for information. Some of the boys are thinking about talking.

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "Let them talk. I'm not hiding."
> "Who's offering the most?"
> "Thank you for the warning."

[All lead to:]
THUG: Just... watch your back, yeah? Whatever you are, you've got powerful people interested.
```

**Brother Feng (Escort Mission):**
```
[Feng appears at a corner]

BROTHER FENG: [Urgent whisper]
Li Wei! Over here!

[Li Wei approaches]

BROTHER FENG: The elders sent me. There's a safe route back to the training ground, but we need to move now. Spartan patrol incoming.

[Stealth/movement sequence following Feng]

BROTHER FENG: [While moving]
Elder Mei is ready to teach you. She's been waiting, she says. Whatever that means. You know how she is.

[They reach safety]

BROTHER FENG: There. Training ground entrance. Good luck with Mei. Try not to let her make you too crazy.

[SCENE TRANSITIONS TO 2.3]
```

### Mechanics Introduced
- Spartan patrols (avoidable combat)
- Stealth elements (staying out of sight)
- Tension meter (optional)

---

## Scene 2.3: Hungry Lessons

**Type:** Training Combat
**Location:** Training Ground - Mei's Den
**Player Input:** Full combat with new stance

### Environment Description

Elder Mei's training area is unlike the others. It's cluttered with half-eaten food, scattered scrolls, and the smell of cooking meat. She trains in chaos because chaos is where hunger lives.

### Script

```
[Li Wei enters Mei's space]

ELDER MEI: [Appearing suddenly]
FINALLY! Chen had you too long! Wu made you too stiff! Now MEI makes you HUNGRY!

[She circles Li Wei like a predator]

ELDER MEI: You know Flowing. You know Weathered. But do you know what it means to WANT?

LI WEI: I've been hungry before. These past weeks—

ELDER MEI: [Waving dismissively]
That's belly-hunger. Anyone feels that. I'm talking about SOUL-hunger. The hunger that makes you DO things. TAKE things. BECOME things!

[She suddenly strikes—Li Wei barely dodges]

ELDER MEI: HA! Good reflexes! But reflexes aren't enough!

[She takes a stance—coiled, dangerous, predatory]

ELDER MEI: The Hungry Stance is not about defense. It's not even about offense. It's about NEED. When you need something badly enough, your chi responds. It FEEDS.

[TRAINING BEGINS]
```

### Training Phases

**Phase 1: Hungry Stance**
```
SYSTEM: "The Hungry Stance prioritizes damage. +30% Attack, -20% Defense."
SYSTEM: "High risk, high reward. For when you MUST win."

ELDER MEI: Feel the hunger in your belly. Let it spread. To your arms. Your palms. Your chi!

[Li Wei enters Hungry Stance]

ELDER MEI: YES! I can feel it! You WANT this!
```

**Phase 2: Ravenous Palm**
```
ELDER MEI: When a wolf is starving, it doesn't nibble. It TEARS!

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Ravenous Palm]

SYSTEM: "Ravenous Palm: 45 Power, 30 Chi Cost. Heavy damage. Heals user for 15% of damage dealt."

[Li Wei uses Ravenous Palm on training dummy]

ELDER MEI: [Delighted]
The wolf awakens! Did you feel how it fed? Your chi taking from theirs?
```

**Phase 3: Feral Combo**
```
ELDER MEI: But one bite is never enough for the truly hungry. We want MORE!

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Feral Combo]

SYSTEM: "Feral Combo: 20 Power ×4-6 hits, 40 Chi Cost. Multi-hit fury. Consecutive hits increase damage."

ELDER MEI: Let the hunger drive each strike! Don't think! WANT!

[Li Wei unleashes Feral Combo]

ELDER MEI: [Cackling]
Beautiful! BEAUTIFUL! You're a natural predator!
```

**Phase 4: Understanding Hunger**
```
ELDER MEI: [Growing serious for once]
Now. The most important lesson.

[She sits, gestures for Li Wei to join]

ELDER MEI: Hunger can save you. It can also consume you.

[She shows her scars]

ELDER MEI: I was too hungry once. Wanted too much. Lost pieces of myself I'll never get back.

[She looks at Li Wei intently]

ELDER MEI: The hungry techniques are powerful. But they're not meant to be your whole diet. Use them when you NEED them. Not when you WANT them.

[She stands]

ELDER MEI: Chen's flow teaches patience. Wu's endurance teaches perseverance. My hunger teaches the final push—when patience and perseverance aren't enough.

ELDER MEI: Together, they make you complete.

[She grins]

ELDER MEI: Now! Let's practice more! I want to see you STARVING!

[Training continues]
```

### Techniques Unlocked
- Ravenous Palm
- Feral Combo
- Hungry Stance mastery

## Scene 2.4: Scarred Jin Returns

**Type:** Combat Encounter
**Location:** Labor Ring - Market
**Player Input:** Full combat

### Setup

```
[Li Wei travels through the Labor Ring, heading toward the Commerce Ring]

[A familiar voice calls out]

SCARRED JIN: Well, well. The beggar who got lucky.

[Jin steps out with three new thugs]

SCARRED JIN: Razor's licking his wounds. Says I can have you. Long as I bring the pendant.

[He cracks his knuckles]

SCARRED JIN: This time, no blind old man to save you.

LI WEI: I don't need saving anymore.

SCARRED JIN: [Laughing]
We'll see about that. BOYS!

[COMBAT BEGINS - Jin + 3 Street Punks]
```

### Combat Notes
- This fight should feel EASIER than Chapter 1
- Demonstrates player's growth
- Jin is stronger but player has more options

### Victory Script

```
[Jin lies beaten, thugs scattered]

SCARRED JIN: [Coughing]
How... you're just... a beggar...

LI WEI: I was never "just" anything.

[Li Wei turns to leave]

SCARRED JIN: [Shouting after]
The Spartans are coming for you! They know what you are! You think you've won?! THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING!

[Li Wei pauses]

LI WEI: Then I'll be ready.

[He walks away]

[SCENE ENDS]
```

---

## Scene 2.5: Rising Through Rings

**Type:** Exploration/Combat
**Location:** Commerce Ring (newly accessible)
**Player Input:** Movement, shopping, random encounters

### Environment Description

The Commerce Ring is a jarring contrast to the Lower Streets. Clean streets. Actual shops with doors. People who look healthy. Guards who protect rather than extort.

But even here, Li Wei feels the weight of the system. Shopkeepers eye his tattered robes. Citizens step aside—not from respect, but disgust.

### Interactive Elements

**Wealthy Merchant (Dismissive):**
```
MERCHANT: [Seeing Li Wei approach]
Beggar! Away! This is a respectable establishment!

LI WEI: I only wanted to ask—

MERCHANT: Guards! GUARDS! There's a vagrant!

[Must flee or defuse]
```

**Kind Shop Girl:**
```
[A young woman at a food stall watches Li Wei with curiosity rather than fear]

SHOP GIRL: [Quietly]
Hey. You look hungry. Here.

[She offers a meat bun]

LI WEI: I can't pay for that.

SHOP GIRL: [Smiling]
I know. That's why I'm giving it to you. Not everyone up here has forgotten what kindness is.

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "Thank you. Truly."
> "Why help someone like me?"
> [Accept silently]

[If "Why help someone like me?"]
SHOP GIRL: My grandmother was from the Lower Streets. She used to say the rings might separate us, but we're all the same underneath.

[She looks around nervously]

SHOP GIRL: Be careful, beggar. The Spartans are asking about someone with your description. Whatever you did, they're very interested.
```

**Spartan Patrol (Harder to Avoid):**
```
[More numerous and alert than in Gang Territory]

SPARTAN: Halt! Identification!

[If caught, must talk or fight way out]
```

### Random Encounters
- Commerce Ring Thugs (better equipped than street punks)
- Spartan Recruits (easier Spartans for practice)

---

## Scene 2.6: Memory Fractures

**Type:** Cutscene (Flashback)
**Location:** Commerce Ring - Near Spire District Border
**Player Input:** None

### Purpose
- Major memory revelation
- Connect to main plot
- Emotional weight

### Script

```
[Li Wei pauses at an overlook. In the distance: the Measuring Spire, gleaming white against the sky]

[The jade pendant suddenly burns hot]

LI WEI: Gah!

[FLASHBACK - More vivid than before]

[Young Li Wei runs through white corridors]

ALARM: "Subject 17 has breached containment! All personnel—"

[Masked figures chase him]

YOUNG LI WEI: [Running]
I'm not a number! I'm not a THING!

[He reaches a window—the Spire visible outside]

[A kind voice calls out]

DR. MAE: [Young woman without mask]
Li Wei! Wait!

[Young Li Wei pauses]

DR. MAE: You can't just run. They'll find you. They'll—

[Soldiers appear behind her]

SOLDIER: Dr. Mae, step aside.

DR. MAE: [Turning]
Don't hurt him! He's just scared!

[The soldiers raise weapons]

DR. MAE: [Desperate]
Li Wei, the pendant! It suppresses your chi! If you remove it—

[Young Li Wei grasps the pendant. The world goes WHITE]

[EXPLOSION OF CHI]

[When the light fades—destruction. Soldiers down. Dr. Mae unconscious but breathing]

[Young Li Wei looks at his hands—crackling with inverse chi]

YOUNG LI WEI: What... what am I?

[He runs, the pendant left behind]

[Then he pauses, goes back, puts it on]

YOUNG LI WEI: [Whispered]
I'm sorry.

[He runs into the night]

[FLASHBACK ENDS]

[Li Wei gasps, on his knees in the Commerce Ring]

PASSERBY: [Distant]
Is that vagrant having a fit? Someone call—

[Li Wei forces himself up and moves before attention gathers]

LI WEI: [Internal]
The pendant suppresses my chi. But I'm stronger WITH it now. What happens... if I take it off?

[He touches it, considers, then leaves it be]

LI WEI: Not yet. Not until I understand.

[SCENE ENDS]
```

---

## Scene 2.7: Advanced Training

**Type:** Training Combat
**Location:** Training Ground
**Player Input:** Full combat, technique refinement

### Purpose
- Learn advanced techniques
- Prepare for boss battle
- Combine all three stances

### Script

```
[All three elders wait for Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: You've learned our basics. Now we teach you to combine them.

ELDER WU: A true beggar adapts. Flow when you must. Endure when you must. Hunger when you must.

ELDER MEI: AND KNOW WHICH IS WHICH!

[Elder Chen steps forward]

ELDER CHEN: I will teach you Rising Dragon—a technique that transcends stance. It works in any form but changes based on which one you use.

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Rising Dragon]

SYSTEM: "Rising Dragon: 35 Power, 35 Chi Cost. Effects vary by stance:
- Flowing: Grants evasion buff
- Weathered: Grants armor buff
- Hungry: Grants damage buff"

[Training demonstrates stance-switching with Rising Dragon]
```

### Advanced Technique Training

```
[Elder Wu approaches]

ELDER WU: Iron Palm. The weathered strike that breaks defense.

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Iron Palm]

SYSTEM: "Iron Palm: 50 Power, 45 Chi Cost. Ignores 50% of enemy defense."

ELDER WU: When someone hides behind their guard, you don't go around. You go THROUGH.

[Elder Mei bounces over]

ELDER MEI: And DESPERATE STRIKE! For when you're almost dead and STILL FIGHTING!

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Desperate Strike]

SYSTEM: "Desperate Strike: 25-100 Power (scales with missing HP), 50 Chi Cost. More powerful the lower your health."

ELDER MEI: When you're cornered, when you're dying, when there's NOTHING LEFT—that's when you hit HARDEST!
```

### Final Training Exercise

```
[The elders nod to each other]

ELDER CHEN: Now. Face all three of us. Simultaneously.

LI WEI: What?

ELDER WU: Consider it your graduation exam.

ELDER MEI: [Already bouncing]
Don't die!

[Training fight against all three elders - difficult but winnable]

[Upon victory:]

ELDER CHEN: [Smiling]
You've grown beyond what we imagined.

ELDER WU: [Nodding]
Adequate. Finally.

ELDER MEI: [Hugging Li Wei]
MY STUDENT IS READY TO BITE THE WORLD!

[Elder Chen grows serious]

ELDER CHEN: The Spartans have narrowed their search. Commander Vex himself is leading the investigation. He'll find us eventually.

[He looks at Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: You could hide. Stay in the shadows. Let this pass.

[Beat]

ELDER CHEN: Or you could face him. Show the law what a beggar can become.

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "I'm done hiding."
> "What would you have me do?"
> "Will you fight beside me?"

[All lead to:]

ELDER CHEN: This is your fight, Li Wei. But know—whatever happens—we believe in you.

[SCENE TRANSITIONS TO 2.8]
```

### Techniques Unlocked
- Rising Dragon
- Iron Palm
- Desperate Strike

## Scene 2.8: The Spartan's Notice

**Type:** Dialogue/Tension
**Location:** Garrison Ring Border
**Player Input:** Dialogue choices

### Script

```
[Li Wei approaches the border to the Garrison Ring—checkpoint with Spartan guards]

[A poster on the wall shows a rough sketch of Li Wei: "WANTED - Unauthorized Martial Practitioner"]

GUARD: Halt. Business in the Garrison Ring?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "Just passing through."
> [Show aggression]
> [Try to slip past]

---

[If "Just passing through":]
GUARD: [Studying Li Wei]
You look familiar. Wait...

[He looks at the poster]

GUARD: [Drawing weapon]
It's him! The vagrant! Alert Commander V—

[A voice interrupts]

COMMANDER VEX: [Approaching calmly]
That won't be necessary, soldier.

[The guard snaps to attention]

GUARD: Commander! This is the—

COMMANDER VEX: I know who he is.

[Vex studies Li Wei with cold, analytical eyes]

COMMANDER VEX: The beggar who defeated Razor. Who has supposedly learned martial arts despite being... what grade are you?

LI WEI: I don't know.

COMMANDER VEX: [Almost smiling]
Of course you don't. The untested vagrant.

[He circles Li Wei]

COMMANDER VEX: My superiors are very interested in you. They didn't specify why. Just that you're a "priority subject."

[Li Wei's blood runs cold at the phrase]

COMMANDER VEX: [Noticing]
That phrase means something to you.

[Beat]

COMMANDER VEX: You could come quietly. Answer questions. Perhaps we could sort this out civilly.

LI WEI: We both know that won't happen.

COMMANDER VEX: [Nodding]
No. I suppose not.

[He takes a fighting stance—formal, perfect, military]

COMMANDER VEX: Then let's see what an F-grade can really do.

[SCENE TRANSITIONS TO 2.9]
```

---

## Scene 2.9: Into the Garrison

**Type:** Combat Gauntlet
**Location:** Garrison Ring
**Player Input:** Multiple combat encounters

### Purpose
- Build tension toward boss
- Fight Spartan enemies
- Show the system's power

### Script

```
[Vex doesn't fight yet—he watches as Li Wei has to battle through Spartan forces]

COMMANDER VEX: [Calling out]
Don't kill him! I want him alive for questioning!

[Wave 1: 3 Spartan Recruits]

SPARTAN RECRUIT: Stop resisting! You're only making it worse!

[Wave 2: 2 Spartan Soldiers]

SPARTAN SOLDIER: Target is skilled! Request backup!

[Wave 3: 1 Spartan Enforcer + 2 Spartan Soldiers]

SPARTAN ENFORCER: [After Li Wei defeats them]
Impossible... how is a vagrant this strong?

[Vex approaches, soldiers backing away]

COMMANDER VEX: Enough.

[The remaining Spartans fall back]

COMMANDER VEX: You've defeated my soldiers. Impressive. They train for years. You, apparently, trained for weeks.

[He removes his ceremonial cloak]

COMMANDER VEX: It would be easy to dismiss this as luck. But I've watched you fight. Your technique is... unorthodox. But real.

[He settles into stance]

COMMANDER VEX: Show me.

[SCENE TRANSITIONS TO 2.10]
```

---

## Scene 2.10: Face of the Law

**Type:** Pre-Boss Dialogue
**Location:** Garrison Ring - Training Arena
**Player Input:** Dialogue

### Script

```
[A cleared arena. Vex and Li Wei face each other. Spartans watch from the edges]

COMMANDER VEX: Before we begin. A question.

[He studies Li Wei]

COMMANDER VEX: Why resist? The system exists to protect people. Those with aptitude serve. Those without are... served. Everyone in their place.

LI WEI: And beggars? Where's our place?

COMMANDER VEX: [Honestly]
Unfortunate casualties. Born without potential. The kindest thing society can do is... leave them be.

LI WEI: Leave them to starve. To freeze. To die.

COMMANDER VEX: An unpleasant truth. But maintaining order requires—

LI WEI: Order? Is that what you call it?

[Li Wei takes his stance]

LI WEI: I call it oppression. And I'm done being oppressed.

COMMANDER VEX: [Almost sad]
Such conviction. Such fire. What a waste that you were born wrong.

[He raises his fist]

COMMANDER VEX: Very well. If you will not submit to law...

[His chi flares—massive, disciplined, terrifying]

COMMANDER VEX: Then law will be enforced.

[BOSS FIGHT BEGINS]
```

---

## Scene 2.11: Commander Vex Boss Fight

**Type:** Boss Combat
**Location:** Garrison Ring - Arena
**Player Input:** Full combat

### Boss: Commander Vex

**Stats:** See ENEMIES.md for full stats
- HP: 600
- Three phases
- Disciplined Fighter AI

### Phase 1: Assessment (100%-70% HP)

```
COMMANDER VEX: [Analytical]
Interesting. Your form is rough but effective.

COMMANDER VEX: [After taking hit]
You strike with desperation. Efficient.

COMMANDER VEX: [Using technique]
Order Strike. Disciplined. Precise. Everything you are not.

[Vex fights cautiously, assessing Li Wei's patterns]
```

### Phase Transition 1→2 (70% HP)

```
[Vex staggers]

COMMANDER VEX: [Surprised]
You actually wounded me. When was the last time...

[He straightens, something shifting in his demeanor]

COMMANDER VEX: I've been holding back. Testing. But you...

[His chi intensifies]

COMMANDER VEX: You deserve my full attention.

[PHASE 2 BEGINS - More aggressive]
```

### Phase 2: Committed (70%-35% HP)

```
COMMANDER VEX: [Attacking harder]
Your technique defies measurement! How?!

COMMANDER VEX: [Frustrated]
Every rule of cultivation says this is impossible!

COMMANDER VEX: [Using Commanding Presence]
ENOUGH! You WILL submit!

[His buff abilities activate - AoE pressure]
```

### Phase Transition 2→3 (35% HP)

```
[Vex falls to one knee]

COMMANDER VEX: [Breathing hard]
Subject 17. That's what they called you.

[Li Wei freezes]

COMMANDER VEX: The reports from my superiors. "Priority Subject." "Anomalous aptitude." "Calibration Initiative escapee."

[He stands]

COMMANDER VEX: I didn't want to believe it. An F-grade who could fight? Impossible. A myth. But you...

[He looks at Li Wei with something like wonder]

COMMANDER VEX: You're proof that everything I've believed is wrong.

[His expression hardens]

COMMANDER VEX: That's why you can't be allowed to exist.

[PHASE 3 BEGINS - Desperate, all-out]
```

### Phase 3: Desperate (35%-0% HP)

```
COMMANDER VEX: [Furious]
If you live, the system FAILS! Everything I've enforced becomes a LIE!

COMMANDER VEX: [Wild attacks]
I've given my LIFE to the law! I can't have been WRONG!

COMMANDER VEX: [Final push]
FOR ORDER! FOR THE SYSTEM! FOR EVERYTHING I BELIEVE!
```

### Victory Sequence

```
[Vex falls, beaten but alive]

[Li Wei stands over him, exhausted]

COMMANDER VEX: [Weakly]
Finish it. You've won. The law... has been... defeated.

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "I'm not going to kill you."
> "The law wasn't what was defeated today."
> "What did you mean—Subject 17?"

---

[IF: "I'm not going to kill you."]
COMMANDER VEX: [Confused]
Why? I would have killed you. The law demands—

LI WEI: Maybe that's the difference between us.

---

[IF: "The law wasn't what was defeated today."]
COMMANDER VEX: [Bitter]
Then what?

LI WEI: A false belief. That some people are worth more than others.

---

[IF: "What did you mean—Subject 17?"]
COMMANDER VEX: [Hesitating]
The Initiative. Secret research. They study anomalies—people who don't fit the system.

[He looks at Li Wei]

COMMANDER VEX: You were one of their subjects. You escaped. They want you back.

LI WEI: Why?

COMMANDER VEX: Because you're proof the Aptitude Array is flawed. And if people learn that...

[He doesn't finish]

---

[CONTINUING]

[Spartans move to surround Li Wei]

COMMANDER VEX: [Raising a hand]
Stand down.

SPARTAN: Commander—

COMMANDER VEX: I said STAND DOWN.

[The Spartans hesitate, then obey]

COMMANDER VEX: [To Li Wei]
Go. Before I change my mind. Before my superiors learn I let you escape.

[Li Wei starts to leave]

COMMANDER VEX: [Calling after]
This isn't over. The Initiative will send others. Worse than me. You should run. Hide. Disappear.

LI WEI: I'm done running.

COMMANDER VEX: [Almost smiling]
Then you'll die. But... perhaps you'll make them earn it.

[Li Wei walks away]

[CHAPTER 2 ENDS]
