# Prologue: The Awakening

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-05
**Status:** `[ELABORATED]`
**Version:** 2.0

---

## Overview

**Prologue Title:** The Awakening
**Estimated Length:** 20-25 minutes
**Location:** Unknown → Lower Streets → Beggar's Corner
**Boss:** None (tutorial section)
**Branching:** None (establishes baseline)

**Narrative Arc:** Void → Confusion → Survival → Discovery → Acceptance
**Theme:** Waking to a world that has already judged you worthless

---

## Purpose

The prologue serves multiple functions:

1. **Tutorial** - Teaches movement, combat basics, dialogue system
2. **Mystery** - Establishes Li Wei's unknown past as central hook
3. **Tone** - Sets the game's atmosphere (dark but not hopeless)
4. **Lore Integration** - Naturally introduces key world elements
5. **Baseline** - All players experience this identically before branching

## Scene P.1: The Void

**Type:** Cutscene (Text and Sound Only)
**Location:** Abstract/Memory Fragment
**Player Input:** None (press any key to advance)

### Design Intent

Create immediate intrigue. The player should feel disoriented, curious, and slightly unsettled. These fragments will pay off in Chapter 2-3.

### Visual Description

```
[BLACK SCREEN]
[No text for 3 seconds - just darkness]
[Then, faint sounds begin]
```

### Script

```
[AMBIENT: Distant, distorted voices - clinical, urgent]

VOICE (MALE, CLINICAL):
"Subject 17's readings are... unprecedented."

VOICE (FEMALE, NERVOUS):
"The inverse flow is accelerating. We should abort—"

VOICE (MALE, AUTHORITATIVE):
"Proceed. Director Shen wants results."

[SOUND: A sharp electronic tone, building]

[FLASH: Brief image - white room, masked figures, hands reaching]

[BLACK]

[SOUND: Something shattering - glass? formations? reality?]

VOICE (FEMALE, SCREAMING):
"It's loose! Subject 17 is—"

[SOUND: Explosion of... something. Not fire. Something else.]

[SILENCE]

[Beat]

[WHITE TEXT ON BLACK, appearing slowly:]

    You dream of white rooms
    and whispered numbers.

    Of hands that measured
    but never touched.

    Of something inside you,
    waiting.

[Beat]

    You dream of running.

    Of an explosion of... something.

    Of falling through darkness
    that felt like freedom.

[Beat]

    You dream of forgetting.

[LONGER BEAT]

    Then you wake.

[FADE TO GREY - Scene P.2]
```

### Audio Design Notes

- Voices should be distorted, as if heard through water or across time
- The "explosion" sound is NOT destructive—it's more like a release, a reversal
- The jade pendant should appear briefly in the flash, glowing with inverse chi
- Silence after the explosion should feel pregnant with meaning

---

## Scene P.2: Grey Sky

**Type:** Interactive Cutscene → Movement Tutorial
**Location:** Unknown Alley (dead-end in Lower Streets)
**Player Input:** Movement begins

### Environment Description

A narrow alley between crumbling brick buildings. Garbage piled against walls. A rusted drainage pipe drips steadily—the only sound besides distant city noise. The sky visible above is grey, overcast. The air smells of rot, old rain, and something chemical from the factories.

Li Wei lies among refuse, barely distinguishable from the garbage around him.

### Script

```
[FADE IN: Li Wei's perspective - blurry, slowly focusing]

[Player sees: grey sky, dark walls, garbage]

[INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - appears as text on screen]

...

Where...

[View sharpens slightly]

Where am I?

[INSTRUCTION: Press [SPACE] to continue]

[Player presses space]

[Li Wei's hands come into view - dirty, scraped, unfamiliar]

These hands.
Are they mine?

[INSTRUCTION: Use [WASD] or [ARROW KEYS] to look around]

[Player can look around the alley - nothing but garbage and walls]

[After looking around:]

I don't remember how I got here.
I don't remember... anything.

[Beat]

Wait.

[Li Wei's hand moves to his chest automatically]

There's something.

[INSTRUCTION: Press [E] to examine]

[Player examines - discovers the jade pendant]

A pendant. Jade, I think.
It feels... important.
Warm, somehow. Like it knows me.

[The pendant pulses faintly with light]

Do I know it?

[Li Wei tries to stand - stumbles, catches himself on the wall]

[INSTRUCTION: Press [W] to stand, then move to exit the alley]

[Player gains movement control]

I need to... I need to find out where I am.
Who I am.

I need to survive.

[Player moves toward alley exit - SCENE P.3 begins]
```

### Tutorial Elements

- **Looking around** - introduces camera/examination
- **Examining objects** - introduces interaction key
- **Standing/Moving** - introduces movement
- **Objective understanding** - player learns "go toward light/exit"

---

## Scene P.3: First Breath

**Type:** Exploration
**Location:** Lower Streets - Guttermouth Area
**Player Input:** Movement, Observation, Optional Interactions

### Environment Description

The Guttermouth plaza opens before Li Wei—the center of the Lower Streets' unofficial heart. A dried fountain (now a stagnant pool) marks the center. Buildings lean at angles that defy architecture. People move through the space—but none meet his eyes.

The sounds: distant arguments, children crying somewhere, the ever-present drip of drainage from upper rings.

### Interactive Elements

**The Begging Mother (Optional):**
```
[A woman sits against a wall, a thin child in her arms]
[She holds out a cracked bowl but doesn't speak]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
She's begging. Like me, I suppose.
Her eyes... they've stopped hoping.

[OPTIONS:]
> [Look away and continue] → No effect
> [Crouch beside her] → Triggers dialogue

[If player crouches:]

BEGGING MOTHER: (not looking up)
Another hungry mouth. The streets don't
care, you know. Neither does the city above.

LI WEI: Where... where am I?

BEGGING MOTHER: (bitter laugh)
The Gutter. Where everything flows down
and nothing flows back up.

[She looks at him for the first time - then at his pendant]
[Her eyes widen slightly]

BEGGING MOTHER: That pendant. Where did you—
No. Never mind. I don't want to know.

[She turns away]

BEGGING MOTHER: If you're smart, you'll
hide that. If you're lucky, you'll die
before they find you.

[She won't speak again]
```

**The Spartan Patrol (Observation Only):**
```
[Two soldiers in polished armor walk through the square]
[Everyone else shrinks away from them]

SPARTAN 1: Another sweep done. Nothing
but rats and refuse.

SPARTAN 2: Commander wants us checking
for "unauthorized martial activity."
Whatever that means.

SPARTAN 1: Means someone above us is
nervous. Not our job to ask why.

[They pass without seeing Li Wei]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Soldiers. Authority.
Something about them makes my skin crawl.
Do I know them? Have I... met them before?

[The pendant grows slightly warm]
```

**The Lean-To Market (Optional Observation):**
```
[Scavengers trade salvage under corrugated metal sheets]

TRADER 1: Three scraps for the wire.
No more.

TRADER 2: It's copper! Pre-Redistribution
copper! Worth ten at least.

TRADER 1: Worth what someone will pay.
Here, no one pays ten for anything.

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
A market. An economy.
These people have almost nothing—
but they've built something from it.
```

### Script (Main Path)

```
[Li Wei emerges from the alley into the plaza]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
People. Noise. Life, of a sort.

[He looks around - no one meets his eye]

They're ignoring me.
No—they're avoiding me.
I'm just another piece of garbage
the city washed down here.

[A man bumps into Li Wei, hard, then keeps walking]

MAN: (not looking back)
Watch it, vagrant.

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Vagrant. Is that what I am?

[Li Wei touches his clothes - torn, dirty, but once quality]

These clothes. They were good once.
What happened to them? To me?

[A child darts past, stops, stares at Li Wei]

CHILD: Mama! There's a dead man walking!

MOTHER'S VOICE: (distant)
Don't look at him! Come away!

[The child runs off]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Dead man walking.
Maybe she's right.
I feel hollow. Empty.
Like something was taken from me
and I can't remember what.

[Objective marker appears toward path forward]

SYSTEM: Follow the path to find shelter
before nightfall.

[Player explores or proceeds - after exploring or directly:]

[Moving toward exit triggers Scene P.4]
```

### Design Notes

- This scene establishes the world's cruelty WITHOUT combat
- Players can explore or proceed directly - both valid
- NPC interactions are optional but reward curiosity
- The Spartan patrol foreshadows Chapter 2
- The begging mother hints at the pendant's significance

---

## Scene P.4: Survival Instinct

**Type:** Tutorial Combat
**Location:** Back Alley (between Guttermouth and deeper streets)
**Player Input:** Full combat tutorial

### Setup

```
[Li Wei walks through a narrow passage]

[SOUND: Footsteps behind him]

[A figure steps out of the shadows ahead - another behind]

THUG 1: (blocking the path)
Well, well. Fresh meat.

THUG 2: (behind Li Wei)
Nice pendant. Bet that's worth something.

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Two of them. Cornered.
I should be afraid.
But instead I feel...

[Li Wei's hands curl into fists automatically]

...ready.

THUG 1: Hand it over, vagrant. The pendant
and anything else you've got.

[CHOICE - First choice of the game, no path impact:]

> [Hand over the pendant]
> [Refuse]

[Either choice leads to combat - if player tries to hand over:]

LI WEI: Take it. I don't want trouble.

[Li Wei reaches for the pendant - it FLARES with warmth]

[He can't take it off - his hands won't obey]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
I can't... I can't give it up.
It won't let me.
Or I won't let me.

THUG 1: Quit stalling! Boys, take it from him!

[Combat begins regardless]

[If player refuses:]

LI WEI: No.

THUG 2: (laughing)
"No"? You don't get to say no, vagrant.

[They advance]

[Combat begins]
```

### Combat Flow

**Turn 1:**
```
TUTORIAL: Select [1] to attack the first thug.

[Player attacks]

[Li Wei strikes - the motion is fluid, practiced, WRONG for
someone who claims no memory]

DAMAGE: 15 to Desperate Thug 1

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
How did I—
That wasn't random. That was technique.
Do I know how to fight?

THUG 1: (staggering)
He's got some moves! Get him!

[Thugs attack - tutorial explains defend]

TUTORIAL: Press [2] to Defend. This reduces damage taken.

[Combat continues - player practices attack/defend cycle]
```

**Mid-Combat:**
```
[When both thugs are at ~50% HP]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
These movements. They're coming from
somewhere. Memory? Instinct?

[Li Wei performs a particularly elegant counter]

Something inside me knows this.
Something that was trained.
Forged.

Who trained me?

[Combat continues]
```

**Victory:**
```
[Both thugs defeated - they flee]

THUG 1: (running)
This one's crazy! Leave him!

THUG 2: (following)
Not worth it! Not worth it!

[Li Wei stands alone, breathing hard]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
I won.
I knew how to win.

[He looks at his hands]

These hands remember what my mind forgot.
Someone taught me to fight.
Before the white rooms. Or during them.

[The pendant cools]

Whatever I am... I'm not helpless.

[VICTORY - Scene P.4 Complete]

REWARDS:
- Combat basics learned
- Foreshadowing of Li Wei's trained past
```

---

## Scene P.5: Days of Nothing

**Type:** Narrative Montage
**Location:** Various Lower Streets locations
**Player Input:** Minimal (advance prompts)

### Purpose

Show time passing. Establish Li Wei's desperation before hope arrives. Make Old Dao's appearance meaningful.

### Script

```
[MONTAGE BEGINS - Series of brief scenes]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                      DAY ONE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Li Wei huddles in an alley as rain falls]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Rain. Cold.
Nothing to eat since I woke.
Nothing to do but survive.

[Press SPACE to continue]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                      DAY TWO
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Li Wei watches others eat scraps from a garbage pile]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
I tried to join them. They drove me away.
Even here, at the bottom, there are hierarchies.
Even here, newcomers aren't welcome.

[Press SPACE to continue]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                      DAY THREE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Li Wei fights off another thug - this time alone]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Another one. Another test.
I'm getting better. Or they're getting weaker.
Or both.

[Combat auto-resolves - Li Wei wins]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                      DAY FOUR
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Li Wei sits against a wall, staring at nothing]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
The pendant stays warm. Even when I'm cold.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
It's the only thing that's mine.

[The pendant pulses]

What are you? What am I?

[Press SPACE to continue]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                      DAY FIVE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Li Wei lies in the same alley where he woke]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Back where I started.
Is this my life now?
Fighting. Starving. Waiting to die?

[Beat]

There has to be more.
There HAS to be.

[He grips the pendant]

Show me. Please. Show me something.

[The pendant flares—briefly, faintly]

[A voice, nearby:]

VOICE: (old, amused)
Talking to jewelry now? That's usually
week two.

[Li Wei looks up - Scene P.6 begins]
```

---

## Scene P.6: The Blind Guide

**Type:** Cutscene with Dialogue Choices
**Location:** Lower Streets - Near Guttermouth
**Player Input:** Dialogue choices (no path impact - tutorial for system)

### Character Introduction: Old Dao

```
[An ancient figure stands at the alley's entrance]
[He's hunched, layered in rags, leaning on a wooden staff]
[His eyes are milky white - blind]
[He's smiling directly at Li Wei]

OLD DAO: Five days. That's longer than most
newcomers last. You're either lucky or
stubborn.

[Li Wei struggles to his feet]

LI WEI: Who are you? How do you know how
long I've been here?

OLD DAO: (tapping his staff)
I know many things. That's what happens
when you stop looking and start seeing.

[He chuckles at his own joke]

OLD DAO: My name is Dao. Old Dao, they call
me. Because I'm old. And my name is Dao.
Clever, yes?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE - Tutorial for choice system:]

> [A: "Are you here to rob me too?"] (Suspicious)
> [B: "Can you help me?"] (Direct)
> [C: "How can you 'see' if you're blind?"] (Curious)

[A - Suspicious:]

LI WEI: Are you here to rob me? I don't
have anything worth taking.

OLD DAO: (laughing)
Rob a man with nothing? That would be
inefficient even for the desperate.
No, young one. I'm here to give, not take.

[Continues below]

[B - Direct:]

LI WEI: Can you help me? I don't know
where I am. I don't know who I am.

OLD DAO: Help is what I do. Though perhaps
not the help you expect.

[Continues below]

[C - Curious:]

LI WEI: How can you see anything? You're
blind.

OLD DAO: (smiling wider)
The eyes see surfaces. The soul sees
truth. Guess which one is more useful?

[Continues below]

[All paths converge:]

OLD DAO: You're lost. Not geographically—
though yes, also that. Lost in the other
way. The deeper way.

[He steps closer - and Li Wei realizes Old Dao
is moving directly toward him despite seeing nothing]

OLD DAO: You don't remember who you are.
Where you came from. What you can do.

[He stops in front of Li Wei]

OLD DAO: But I see it. The shape of you.
The potential.

[He reaches out, touches the pendant without
asking permission]

[The pendant FLARES—brighter than ever]

OLD DAO: Ah. Yes. There you are.

LI WEI: (jerking back)
What did you—what is this thing?

OLD DAO: A key. A lock. A question and
an answer. All at once.

[He withdraws his hand]

OLD DAO: Come with me, Li Wei. I know
people who can help.

LI WEI: How do you know my name?!

OLD DAO: (already walking)
The pendant told me. Or you did, just
now. Does it matter which?

[He doesn't look back]

OLD DAO: Come. Or stay. The path only
opens once.

[SYSTEM: Follow Old Dao?]
[Press SPACE to follow]

[Li Wei follows - what else can he do?]
```

### The Walk

```
[Old Dao leads Li Wei through winding streets]
[The old man moves impossibly fast for someone blind]

OLD DAO: (not slowing)
You've been fighting. The streets teach
that quickly. But you fight... differently.

LI WEI: (keeping up)
I don't know why. My body remembers
things my mind doesn't.

OLD DAO: Mmm. Muscle memory. Someone
trained you well.

[They turn into an alley that looks like a dead end]

LI WEI: Trained? Who? Where?

OLD DAO: Questions that might have answers.
But not from me.

[He presses a specific stone in the wall]
[A section of "rubble" shifts—revealing a passage]

OLD DAO: From them.

[Light spills through the opening - warm,
golden, the first warm light Li Wei has seen]

[Voices inside - people. Many people.]

OLD DAO: Welcome to the Beggars Sect,
Li Wei. Welcome to your new family.

[Scene P.7 begins]
```

---

## Scene P.7: The Hidden Corner

**Type:** Arrival/Cutscene
**Location:** Beggar's Corner
**Player Input:** Minimal (observation, one choice)

### Environment Description

The Hidden Corner opens before Li Wei—and it's nothing like the streets outside. A courtyard surrounded by ancient walls, deliberately hidden. At the center, an ancient tree (the Beggar's Pine) with hundreds of cloth strips tied to its branches. Around the edges, covered areas where people rest, talk, live.

And at the center of everything: three figures waiting.

### Script

```
[Li Wei steps through the passage into light]

[The contrast is immediate—warmth, community, life]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
This place...
It's still poor. Still hidden. Still at
the bottom of the world.
But it's ALIVE in a way the streets aren't.

[He sees people - beggars, but not broken]
[They move with purpose. Some train. Some cook.
Some laugh.]

This isn't survival. This is... home.
Someone's home.

[Old Dao leads him toward the center]
[Three figures wait beneath the Beggar's Pine]

OLD DAO: Elders. I bring a newcomer.

[The three figures turn:]

ELDER CHEN: (Kind eyes, warm smile)
So this is him. The one you've been
watching.

ELDER WU: (Stern, arms crossed)
Looks half-dead. Are you sure, old man?

ELDER MEI: (Intense, hungry expression)
Oh, I like his eyes. There's something
in there. Something waiting.

OLD DAO: (to Li Wei)
These are the Elders of the Beggars Sect.
Chen. Wu. Mei. They lead what remains of
us.

[He gestures for Li Wei to step forward]

OLD DAO: Show them the pendant.

LI WEI: What?

OLD DAO: Trust me. Show them.

[Li Wei hesitates, then lifts the pendant]

[All three Elders' expressions change]

[Elder Chen's eyes widen]
[Elder Wu's arms uncross]
[Elder Mei leans forward hungrily]

ELDER CHEN: (quietly)
Where did you get that?

LI WEI: I... I woke up with it. I don't
know where it came from.

ELDER WU: (to Chen)
Is it authentic?

ELDER CHEN: (still staring)
Yes. It's real. I've seen one before.
Once. Forty years ago.

ELDER MEI: (to Li Wei)
Do you know what it IS?

LI WEI: No. Nothing. I don't remember
anything.

[Long pause]

[The Elders exchange looks]

ELDER CHEN: (finally)
Young man. What is your name?

LI WEI: Li Wei. At least... I think so.
It's the only thing I know for certain.

ELDER CHEN: Li Wei. Do you know why you
fought so well in the streets? Why your
body knows techniques your mind has
forgotten?

LI WEI: No.

ELDER CHEN: Neither do I. Not yet.

[He steps forward, placing a hand on Li Wei's shoulder]

ELDER CHEN: But I believe we can find out.
Together.

[SYSTEM: Elder Chen offers to teach you.]

[DIALOGUE CHOICE:]

> [A: "What is this place?"]
> [B: "What do you want from me?"]
> [C: "I accept."]

[A - What is this place:]

LI WEI: What is this place? The "Beggars
Sect"?

ELDER CHEN: We are the forgotten who chose
not to forget. The discarded who found
value in each other. The empty who
discovered fullness in emptiness.

[He smiles]

ELDER CHEN: We are beggars. And we are
free.

[B - What do you want:]

LI WEI: What do you want from me?

ELDER WU: (gruffly)
A fair question. Most who wash up here
want something. We do too.

ELDER CHEN: (gentle)
We want to help you discover what you
are. In return, we hope you'll help us
preserve what we are.

ELDER MEI: (grinning)
Also, we're always looking for new
fighters. And you can FIGHT, can't you?

[C - Accept:]

[All paths lead here:]

LI WEI: I... I accept. Whatever this is.
Wherever this leads. I accept.

[Elder Chen smiles warmly]

ELDER CHEN: Then welcome, Li Wei, to
the Beggars Sect.

[He gestures to the courtyard]

ELDER CHEN: Welcome home.

[OLD DAO watches from the shadows, nodding to
himself, then—between one moment and the next—
he's gone]

[SYSTEM: PROLOGUE COMPLETE]

[FADE TO BLACK]

[Text appears:]

    Li Wei has found shelter.
    But shelter is just the beginning.

    Questions remain:
    - What is the pendant?
    - Who trained Li Wei?
    - What are the white rooms in his dreams?

    And beyond the Hidden Corner,
    forces are already stirring.
    Forces that want him back.

## Design Notes

### Pacing
- Prologue should feel SLOW initially—the despair is intentional
- Days of Nothing montage prevents tedium while showing time
- Old Dao's appearance is the "inciting incident"
- Arrival at sect ends on hope, contrast with earlier despair

### Tone
- Dark but not nihilistic
- Even in despair, Li Wei acts (fights back)
- Community exists even at the bottom
- Mystery/intrigue balances grimness

### Foreshadowing
- White rooms = Calibration Initiative (Ch2 reveal)
- Pendant significance = Ch2-3 payoff
- Old Dao's nature = ongoing mystery
- Trained body = Initiative experiments

### Tutorial Integration
- Movement: Scene P.2-P.3
- Examination: Scene P.2
- Combat: Scene P.4
- Dialogue choices: Scene P.6
- All tutorials feel natural, not forced
