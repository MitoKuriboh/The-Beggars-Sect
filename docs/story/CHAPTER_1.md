### Opening Script

```
[FADE IN - Morning light filters through gaps in the walls]

[Li Wei wakes in the Sleeping Quarters - a mat on the floor,
a thin blanket, but warm. Safe.]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
I slept. Actually slept.
No dreams of white rooms. No waking to danger.
Just... rest.

[He sits up, looks around]

Other mats, other sleepers. Fellow beggars.
Fellow... family?

Is that what they are now?

[SYSTEM: Welcome to Beggar's Corner. Explore and speak
with residents to learn about your new home.]

[Player gains free movement]
```

### Interactive NPCs & Locations

#### The Beggar's Pine (Central)

```
[The ancient tree at the Corner's heart]
[Hundreds of cloth strips hang from its branches]
[Each strip has writing - names, prayers, memories]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
So many strips. So many names.

[Examining closer:]

"Wang Ji - remembered"
"The forty-seven who fell in Year 15"
"For Elder Shu, who taught us hunger is not weakness"

This tree holds their history.
The people they've lost.
The things they refuse to forget.

[A beggar nearby notices Li Wei looking]

BEGGAR: (quietly)
Every member writes their name when they join.
Every member who dies, we add "remembered."

[She touches one strip gently]

BEGGAR: My mother's. Thirty years ago.

[She walks away without another word]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
They remember their dead.
In a world that forgot them, they remember.
```

#### Grandmother Bone (Bone Yard) - OPTIONAL

```
[A small area filled with animal bones, cleaned and arranged]
[An impossibly old woman sits among them, sorting]

GRANDMOTHER BONE: (not looking up)
Another new one. They always come to stare
at the bones.

LI WEI: What... what is this place?

GRANDMOTHER BONE: The Bone Yard. I read futures
in what others throw away.

[She finally looks at Li Wei - her eyes are sharp,
penetrating, despite her age]

GRANDMOTHER BONE: Sit. Let me see your fortune.

[CHOICE:]
> [Sit and let her read] → Triggers reading
> [Politely decline] → Miss optional content

[If player sits:]

[Grandmother Bone takes Li Wei's hand, traces the lines]
[Then she freezes]

GRANDMOTHER BONE: (voice changed - harder)
Your lines... they're wrong.

LI WEI: Wrong?

GRANDMOTHER BONE: Life, fate, fortune—they all
flow one direction. Yours flow...

[She drops his hand abruptly]

GRANDMOTHER BONE: Backward. Everything backward.

[Long pause]

GRANDMOTHER BONE: You're not natural, boy. Whatever
made you, whatever broke you—it changed the very
flow of your being.

[She reaches into her bone pile, pulls out a small
charm made of interlocking bones]

GRANDMOTHER BONE: Take this. Won't protect you
from what's coming. But might buy you time.

[OBTAINED: Grandmother's Charm]
[Effect: +10 Max HP permanently]

GRANDMOTHER BONE: Now go. Your presence disturbs
my readings.

[She won't speak again]
```

#### Brother Feng (Training Ground)

```
[A young man practices strikes against a wooden post]
[He's fast but sloppy - enthusiasm over technique]

[He notices Li Wei and grins]

BROTHER FENG: Hey! The new guy! Li Wei, right?
I'm Feng. Brother Feng.

[He bounds over, energy infectious]

BROTHER FENG: Man, you've got the whole Corner
buzzing. Old Dao brought you? That's rare. He
mostly just sits in corners being cryptic.

LI WEI: You know Old Dao?

BROTHER FENG: Everyone knows OF him. No one
knows him. He's been around longer than the
Elders remember.

[He lowers his voice conspiratorially]

BROTHER FENG: Some say he was around before
the Array. Like, PRE-Redistribution.

LI WEI: That would make him—

BROTHER FENG: Ancient. Yeah. But here's the
thing—I've never seen him eat. Never seen
him sleep. Never seen him anywhere except
exactly where something important is about
to happen.

[He shrugs]

BROTHER FENG: Creepy? Little bit. But he
brought YOU, so he can't be all bad.

[He slaps Li Wei on the shoulder]

BROTHER FENG: Come on, let's spar! I want
to see what you've got!

[CHOICE:]
> [Accept the friendly spar] → Sparring tutorial
> [Decline - need to explore first] → Later

[If spar:]

[Basic sparring match - tutorial for chi mechanics]
[Feng is enthusiastic but beatable]

BROTHER FENG: (after loss)
Okay, okay, you're good. Really good.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

LI WEI: I don't know. I don't remember.

BROTHER FENG: (whistling)
Mysterious. I like it.

[He grins]

BROTHER FENG: We're going to be friends,
Li Wei. I can tell.

[RELATIONSHIP: Brother Feng +1]
```

#### The Communal Kitchen

```
[An open area with cook fires and shared pots]
[The smell of rice porridge - simple but warm]

[Several beggars sit eating, talking quietly]

BEGGAR 1: Another patrol last night. Third
this week.

BEGGAR 2: The Spartans are looking for someone.
Something's got them nervous.

BEGGAR 1: As long as they don't find the Corner,
let them search.

[Li Wei can take a bowl of porridge]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
Real food. Hot food.
When did I last eat something that wasn't
scraps from garbage?

[Eating restores HP to full]
```

### Elder Chen Summons

After exploring (or immediately if player seeks him):

```
[A young beggar approaches Li Wei]

MESSENGER: Elder Chen wants to see you.
Elder's Quarters.

[Points to the building]

MESSENGER: Don't keep him waiting. I mean,
he'll wait—he's patient like that—but it's
rude, you know?

[Elder's Quarters becomes marked as objective]
```

### Elder Chen's Introduction

```
[The Elder's Quarters are simple - a meditation space
with cushions, scrolls on walls, a low table with tea]

[Elder Chen sits, waiting, smiling]

ELDER CHEN: Ah, Li Wei. Please, sit. Tea?

[Li Wei sits]

ELDER CHEN: You've had time to see our home.
What do you think?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE:]
> [A: "It's more than I expected."]
> [B: "Why do you live like this?"]
> [C: "How has this place stayed hidden?"]

[A - More than expected:]

LI WEI: It's more than I expected. The
streets outside are... harsh. This place
is almost peaceful.

ELDER CHEN: (nodding)
Peace requires effort. We work to maintain
this sanctuary because without it, we
would have nothing.

[B - Why live like this:]

LI WEI: Why do you live like this? Hidden
underground, scraping by?

ELDER CHEN: (sad smile)
Because the alternative is death. Or worse—
losing ourselves entirely. The world above
declared us worthless. Here, we define our
own worth.

[C - How stay hidden:]

LI WEI: How has this place stayed hidden?
The Spartans patrol everywhere.

ELDER CHEN: They patrol where they expect
to find things. We exist where they don't
expect. Also...

[He gestures to the walls]

ELDER CHEN: These stones are old. Older
than the city above. They have their own
ways of hiding what they shelter.

[All paths converge:]

ELDER CHEN: But you didn't come here for
philosophy. You came because you're lost.

[He studies Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: Old Dao believes you're special.
The pendant you carry suggests he may be
right. But belief and potential are nothing
without cultivation.

LI WEI: Cultivation?

ELDER CHEN: Training. Development. Becoming
what you could be.

[He stands]

ELDER CHEN: I would like to teach you,
Li Wei. The path of the Beggars Sect.
Our techniques. Our philosophy.

[Beat]

ELDER CHEN: It will be difficult. You will
suffer. You may fail. But if you succeed...

[He meets Li Wei's eyes]

ELDER CHEN: You will become something this
world has forgotten how to measure.

[CHOICE - Significant:]
> [Accept training]
> [Ask what's in it for you]
> [Ask what's in it for them]

[All lead to acceptance, but responses vary]

ELDER CHEN: Then we begin tomorrow. Rest today.
Eat. Meet your new family.

[He returns to sitting]

ELDER CHEN: And Li Wei? Welcome.

[SCENE 1.1 COMPLETE]

## Scene 1.2: First Lessons

**Type:** Training Combat & Dialogue
**Location:** Training Ground
**Duration:** 20-25 minutes
**Player Input:** Combat tutorial (advanced), technique learning

### Opening

```
[DAWN - Training Ground]

[Elder Chen waits, standing still as stone]
[Brother Feng and several other beggars watch from the edges]

ELDER CHEN: Good. You're punctual.

[Li Wei approaches]

ELDER CHEN: Today, you learn the first stance
of the Beggars Sect. The Flowing Stance.

[He demonstrates - his body shifts, becoming fluid,
loose, water-like]

ELDER CHEN: We do not meet force with force.
We redirect. We flow. We let aggression pass
through us and become nothing.

[He returns to normal standing]

ELDER CHEN: Attack me.

LI WEI: What?

ELDER CHEN: Attack. However you like.

[COMBAT TUTORIAL: Attack Elder Chen]
[Every attack misses or is gently redirected]
[Chen doesn't counterattack - just flows]

[After several attempts:]

ELDER CHEN: You see? Your strikes have
power. But power without direction is
merely noise.

[He takes Li Wei's arm gently]

ELDER CHEN: Now. I will show you how to
BE the water, not fight it.

```
ELDER CHEN: The stance alone is foundation.
Now, learn to strike from it.

[He demonstrates - a fluid palm strike that
seems slow but arrives instantly]

ELDER CHEN: Flowing Strike. Not powerful,
but it opens possibilities.

[Training begins - player practices against
training dummy]

### Learning: Stream Palm

```
ELDER CHEN: One more technique for today.
Stream Palm.

[He demonstrates - a two-handed push that

ELDER CHEN: This strike pushes. Against
aggressive enemies, it creates space.
Against defensive enemies, it breaks
their stance.

### Testing Combat

```
ELDER CHEN: Now. Let's see you use them.

[Feng steps forward, grinning]

BROTHER FENG: My turn! Come on, Li Wei,
show me what Chen taught you!

[TRAINING COMBAT: Brother Feng]
[Feng fights aggressively - perfect for
practicing Flowing Stance's evasion]

[After victory:]

BROTHER FENG: (laughing, on the ground)
Okay, okay, I yield! Man, you pick things
up FAST.

ELDER CHEN: (nodding approval)
Good. Better than good. You have instinct
for this.

[He pauses, studying Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: Almost as if you've done it
before.

[Li Wei touches his pendant unconsciously]

LI WEI: Maybe I have. I don't remember.

ELDER CHEN: Memory is a river. Sometimes
it flows underground for a while. But it
always resurfaces.

[He bows slightly]

ELDER CHEN: Rest. Tomorrow, you meet
Elder Wu. Her lessons are... different.

[He walks away]

[SCENE 1.2 COMPLETE]
```

---

## CHOICE POINT 1: Brother Feng's Challenge

**Type:** Major Choice
**Trigger:** After Scene 1.2, during free exploration

### Setup

```
[Li Wei is exploring/resting when Feng approaches]
[Feng's expression is different - less joking, more tense]

BROTHER FENG: Hey. Li Wei. Got a minute?

LI WEI: What's wrong?

BROTHER FENG: (sighing)
Look, I... I need to ask you something.
And I need you to be honest.

[He looks around, makes sure they're alone]

BROTHER FENG: How are you so GOOD?

LI WEI: What?

BROTHER FENG: At fighting! At techniques!
I've been here two years. TWO YEARS. And
you show up and in one day you're already
better than me.

[His frustration is real, but not angry]

BROTHER FENG: I'm not jealous. Okay, I'm
a little jealous. But mostly I just...
I want to understand.

LI WEI: Feng, I don't know how to explain
it. My body just... knows.

BROTHER FENG: (nodding slowly)
Yeah. Yeah, that's what Chen says. Natural
talent or some buried past or whatever.

[He squares his shoulders]

BROTHER FENG: So here's the thing. The other
disciples are talking. Some of them think
you're special. Some think you're a spy.
Some think Chen's playing favorites.

[Beat]

BROTHER FENG: If you want to fit in here—
REALLY fit in—you need to prove yourself.
Not to Chen. To them.
```

### The Choice

```
[MAJOR CHOICE POINT - Path Alignment]

BROTHER FENG: So... what do you want to do
about it?

> [A: "Challenge whoever doubts me to a duel."]
> [B: "Let me help with something. Prove myself through service."]
> [C: "Who's talking? I want to know who my enemies are."]

[CHOICE A = +1 Blade]
[CHOICE B = +1 Stream]
[CHOICE C = +1 Shadow]
```

---

## Scene 1.3A: The Proving Ground (Blade Path)

**Type:** Combat Challenge
**Trigger:** Choice A

```
BROTHER FENG: (grinning)
NOW we're talking! All right, I know just
the guy. Brother Kang. He's been the loudest
about you being "suspicious."

[Cut to Training Ground - evening]

[A muscular beggar stands waiting - KANG]
[Other disciples have gathered to watch]

KANG: So the newcomer wants to fight?
Fine. Let's see if you're as good as
Chen thinks.

ELDER WU: (appearing from shadows)
If there's to be a proving, I'll oversee it.

[She steps forward - stern, arms crossed]

ELDER WU: Standard rules. First to yield
or fall. No permanent damage.

[She looks between them]

ELDER WU: Begin.

[COMBAT: Brother Kang]
[Kang is stronger but slower - uses power over technique]
[Good test for Flowing Stance's evasion]

[Victory:]

KANG: (on the ground, shocked)
How... you moved like water...

LI WEI: (offering hand)
No hard feelings?

KANG: (taking it, slowly)
...No. No hard feelings. You're the real
thing.

[He bows, stiffly]

KANG: Welcome to the sect. Brother.

[CROWD MURMURS - respect]

ELDER WU: (to Li Wei)
You fight well. But fighting well isn't
enough. Tomorrow, I teach you to fight
HARD.

[She walks away]

[FENG claps Li Wei on the shoulder]

BROTHER FENG: THAT was awesome! Did you
see his face when you dodged that punch?

[SCENE 1.3A COMPLETE]
[Path: Blade +1]
[Reputation: Known as fighter]
```

---

## Scene 1.3B: Service in Shadows (Stream Path)

**Type:** Exploration & Social
**Trigger:** Choice B

```
BROTHER FENG: (thoughtful)
Okay, that could work. Actually... the
kitchen needs help. Sister Lin's been
complaining about being short-handed.

[He leans in]

BROTHER FENG: I know it sounds small, but
trust me—EVERYONE notices who helps in the
kitchen. Food is life down here.

[Cut to Communal Kitchen]

SISTER LIN: (a middle-aged woman, tired but kind)
Feng said you wanted to help? Good. Grab
a knife. We have vegetables that need
cutting.

[MINI-GAME: Cooking assistance]
[Simple rhythm-based chopping]
[During the work, conversations happen]

SISTER LIN: You're the new one. The mystery
boy Chen's so excited about.

LI WEI: I'm not sure "excited" is the word.

SISTER LIN: (laughing)
Chen doesn't get excited. But for him,
slight interest IS excitement.

[More chopping]

SISTER LIN: You know what I've learned in
twenty years in this kitchen?

LI WEI: What?

SISTER LIN: The fighters get the glory. The
cooks keep everyone alive. Both matter.
Neither works alone.

[She puts a hand on Li Wei's shoulder]

SISTER LIN: You're helping. That means
you understand.

[OTHER BEGGARS passing through see Li Wei working]
[Nods of approval]

[Later - the meal is served]

[Li Wei sits with the disciples, eating what
he helped make]

BEGGAR: (to Li Wei)
Hey, this is good. You help make it?

LI WEI: Just chopped vegetables.

BEGGAR: (nodding)
That's something. That's real.

[BROTHER KANG approaches - the doubter]

KANG: (gruffly)
Heard you helped in the kitchen.

[Pause]

KANG: ...That's all right then.

[He walks away - not warm, but not hostile]

FENG: (whispering)
See? Service speaks louder than words.

[SCENE 1.3B COMPLETE]
[Path: Stream +1]
[Reputation: Known as helpful]
```

---

## Scene 1.3C: Secrets in Stone (Shadow Path)

**Type:** Investigation & Stealth
**Trigger:** Choice C

```
BROTHER FENG: (uncomfortable)
You want to know who's talking?

LI WEI: I want to know everything. Who
doubts me, why, and what they're hiding.

FENG: (slowly)
That's... kind of paranoid.

LI WEI: In my position, wouldn't you be?

[Feng considers]

FENG: Yeah. Fair point.

[He lowers his voice]

FENG: Okay. Brother Kang's the loudest.
Sister Mei—not Elder Mei, different person—
she's been asking questions too. And there's
a guy, Whisper, who doesn't talk much but
watches EVERYTHING.

[Beat]

FENG: If you want to know what they really
think... you'll have to listen without them
knowing.

[STEALTH SEQUENCE begins]

[Li Wei can move through the Corner, listening
to conversations without being noticed]

CONVERSATION 1 - Kang and Another:
"I'm telling you, no one learns that fast.
Either he's a plant or he's hiding something."
"What if he's telling the truth? What if he
really doesn't remember?"
"Then he's dangerous anyway. Unknowns are
always dangerous."

CONVERSATION 2 - Sister Mei and Others:
"The pendant. Did you see it? Jade, old jade.
That's not beggar jewelry."
"Could be stolen."
"He didn't steal it. Did you see how he
touched it? That's personal."

CONVERSATION 3 - Whisper (alone, muttering):
"The pendant. The Initiative's mark. I've
seen it before. Subject 11 had one.
Before they... before..."
[He stops, shuddering]
"If he's from THERE... he's either
victim or weapon. Either way, trouble."

[Li Wei processes this]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
The Initiative. That word again.
Whisper knows something. About me.
About this pendant.

[CHOICE:]
> [Confront Whisper now] → Different outcome
> [Store this information for later] → Main path

[If confront:]

LI WEI: (stepping out)
What do you know about the Initiative?

WHISPER: (startled)
You— how long were you—

[He backs away]

WHISPER: I know nothing. Forget I said anything.

LI WEI: Subject 11. You mentioned Subject 11.
I'M Subject 17.

[Whisper goes pale]

WHISPER: Then you should be dead. They
don't let subjects go.

[He grabs Li Wei's arm]

WHISPER: They'll come for you. They ALWAYS
come for escaped subjects.

[He releases, backs away]

WHISPER: Stay away from me. I survived by
being invisible. You'll get us all killed.

[He flees]

[Store information - return to main path]

[Li Wei returns to Feng]

FENG: Well? Learn anything useful?

LI WEI: (carefully)
I learned that I need to be careful. And
that some secrets are better kept.

FENG: (nodding)
Welcome to the sect, Li Wei. Everyone here
has secrets.

[SCENE 1.3C COMPLETE]
[Path: Shadow +1]
[Reputation: Known as observant]
[FLAG: Whisper_Confronted = true]
```

## Scene 1.4: Second Teacher

**Type:** Training Combat & Dialogue
**Location:** Training Ground
**Duration:** 20 minutes

### Introduction to Elder Wu

```
[DAWN - Training Ground]

[Elder Wu stands like a statue - unmoved, unmoving]
[Her stance is different from Chen's - rooted, solid]

ELDER WU: You're the one Chen praises.

[Li Wei bows]

ELDER WU: Stop. Don't bow until you've
earned it.

[She circles him like a predator]

ELDER WU: Chen teaches flow. I teach
endurance. His path avoids damage.
Mine survives it.

[She stops in front of him]

ELDER WU: The world will hit you. It
will hit you when you're ready and
when you're not. My question is:
will you break?

[She throws a punch without warning]

[If player has good reflexes - dodge possible]
[If player doesn't dodge - hit lands, but Li Wei
stays standing]

ELDER WU: (either way)
Mmm. Let's begin.
```

### Learning: Weathered Stance

```
ELDER WU: The Weathered Stance. Not water.
Stone that has survived a thousand storms.

[She demonstrates - low, rooted, immovable]

ELDER WU: In this stance, you do not dodge.
You do not retreat. You ENDURE. And then
you strike back.

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

### Learning: Weathered Palm

```
ELDER WU: Now. The strike that answers pain.

[She demonstrates - a heavy palm strike that
uses the body's full weight]

ELDER WU: When they think they've hurt you,
hurt them back. Worse.

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

### Learning: Steadfast Guard

```
ELDER WU: And this. For when you cannot
attack, but WILL NOT fall.

[She demonstrates - a defensive posture that
seems to absorb impacts]

### Training Combat

```
ELDER WU: Now. Survive.

[She attacks - full force]

[TRAINING COMBAT: Elder Wu]
[Wu hits HARD - player must use Weathered Stance
to survive and find openings]

[This fight is meant to be difficult but winnable]

[After taking sufficient damage:]

ELDER WU: (stopping)
Enough.

[Li Wei is bruised but standing]

ELDER WU: You didn't fall.

LI WEI: (catching breath)
Was I supposed to?

ELDER WU: (almost smiling)
Most do.

[She studies him]

ELDER WU: Chen wasn't wrong about you.
There's iron in your bones.

[She turns to leave, then pauses]

ELDER WU: The streets outside are getting
dangerous. Gang called Razor's boys have
been expanding. They may come for the
Corner eventually.

[She looks back]

ELDER WU: When they do, you'll need both
stances. Flow AND endurance. Remember that.

[She leaves]

[SCENE 1.4 COMPLETE]
```

---

## Scene 1.5: The Gang Problem

**Type:** Exploration, Dialogue, World Event
**Trigger:** After 1.4, during exploration

### The Threat Arrives

```
[Li Wei is in the Corner when SHOUTING begins]

VOICES: Someone's coming! The hidden entrance!

[Li Wei rushes to the entrance with others]

[A young beggar stumbles through, bloodied]

BLOODIED BEGGAR: They found... they found
the outer marker...

ELDER CHEN: (arriving)
Who? Who found it?

BLOODIED BEGGAR: Razor's gang. They're
demanding... tribute. Said if we don't
pay, they'll...

[He collapses - others catch him]

ELDER CHEN: (to others)
Get him to the healers.

[He turns to the gathered disciples]

ELDER CHEN: It seems we have a problem.

[ELDER WU arrives]

ELDER WU: Razor. That little thug's been
growing bold since he took over the Iron
Dogs.

ELDER MEI: (appearing, excited)
Are we fighting? Please tell me we're
fighting!

ELDER CHEN: We're... discussing.

[He looks at Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: Come. All of you. We need
to decide how to handle this.
```

### The Council

```
[Elder's Quarters - all three Elders present]
[Li Wei, Feng, and several senior disciples attend]

ELDER CHEN: The situation: Razor's gang
has discovered our outer perimeter. Not
the Corner itself, but they know we're
somewhere in the area.

ELDER WU: They're demanding "protection
money." A thousand credits a month or
they start tearing up the neighborhood
looking for us.

ELDER MEI: (snorting)
We don't HAVE a thousand credits a month.
We barely have food.

ELDER CHEN: Precisely. Which means we need
another solution.

[He looks around the room]

ELDER CHEN: Options?

DISCIPLE 1: We could relocate. Find another
hidden spot.

ELDER WU: And abandon everything we've built
here? The training grounds, the Pine, our
ancestors' memory?

DISCIPLE 2: We could fight. We have numbers—

ELDER MEI: (interrupting)
Against Razor? He's got forty thugs. We
have twelve who can fight. The math doesn't
work.

[Silence]

ELDER CHEN: (to Li Wei)
You're new. You see with fresh eyes.
What would you suggest?

[All eyes turn to Li Wei]
```

### Intelligence Gathering

Before the choice, player can ask questions:

```
LI WEI: Who is Razor, exactly?

ELDER WU: A street thug who got ambitious.
Real name unknown. Takes the name because
he cut a man's face off for looking at him
wrong.

ELDER MEI: But here's the thing—he fights
like he's trained. Not just brawling. Real
technique. Someone taught him.

LI WEI: What does he actually want?

ELDER CHEN: Power. Territory. He's not
political—he doesn't care about the
Aptitude System. He just wants to be king
of the gutter.

LI WEI: Does he have weaknesses?

ELDER WU: Pride. He never backs down from
a direct challenge. It's how he got where
he is.

ELDER MEI: (grinning)
Also, his second-in-command, Scarred Jin,
is an idiot. Loyal but stupid.

LI WEI: What about the other gangs?

ELDER CHEN: (interested)
Other gangs? There's the Bone Collectors,
what's left of the Iron Dogs before Razor
absorbed them, the Ratlings...

ELDER WU: All smaller than Razor. But combined...

[This provides context for Stream path]

LI WEI: Is there anything Razor's hiding?
Anything that could be used against him?

ELDER MEI: (eyes narrowing)
Rumors. He used to work for someone in
the upper rings. Someone he doesn't talk
about anymore.

ELDER CHEN: (thoughtful)
If that connection could be proven...
the Spartans would be very interested.

[This provides context for Shadow path]
```

---

## CHOICE POINT 2: How to Deal with Razor

**Type:** Major Choice
**This choice shapes the rest of Chapter 1 significantly**

```
ELDER CHEN: So, Li Wei. What do you think
we should do?

[MAJOR CHOICE POINT - Determines Chapter 1 resolution]

> [A: "I'll challenge Razor directly. His pride won't let him refuse."]
> [B: "Let me talk to the other gangs. Together, we can pressure him."]
> [C: "I'll find proof of his upper ring connection. Use it against him."]

[CHOICE A = +2 Blade, leads to 1.6A Boss Fight]
[CHOICE B = +2 Stream, leads to 1.6B Alliance Path]
[CHOICE C = +2 Shadow, leads to 1.6C Blackmail Path]
```

---

## Scene 1.6A: Direct Challenge (Blade Path)

**Duration:** 30 minutes (includes boss fight)

### Preparation

```
ELDER CHEN: A direct challenge. Bold.
Perhaps foolish. But bold.

ELDER WU: (nodding slowly)
Razor's pride is his weakness. He CAN'T
refuse a public challenge. It would
destroy his reputation.

ELDER MEI: (excited)
Finally! Violence! I was getting bored
with all the talking.

ELDER CHEN: (to Li Wei)
Are you certain? Razor is dangerous.
He's killed people.

LI WEI: I'm certain.

ELDER CHEN: Then prepare. Wu, Mei—give
him what you can.

[TRAINING MONTAGE - Optional additional technique]

ELDER WU: The duel will be to submission
or death. Razor won't hold back.

[She teaches one more technique]

ELDER CHEN: And from me...

[He places a hand on Li Wei's shoulder]

ELDER CHEN: Remember: you fight not for
pride, but for family. Let that give you
strength.

[Li Wei's chi flares—briefly, the pendant glows]

[BUFF: "Elder's Blessing" - +10% all stats for boss fight]
```

### The Challenge

```
[GANG TERRITORY - Night]

[Li Wei walks into the territory alone]
[Thugs emerge from shadows, surrounding him]

THUG 1: Look what wandered in. Fresh meat.

THUG 2: Boss is gonna love this.

LI WEI: (loudly)
I'm here to challenge Razor. One on one.
Public combat. For territory rights.

[Laughter from the thugs]

THUG 1: You're challenging the BOSS? You
must be crazy.

[A voice cuts through]

RAZOR: (emerging from shadows)
What's all the noise?

[RAZOR steps forward - lean, sharp-featured,
dangerous. A scar runs across his cheek.]

RAZOR: A beggar? Challenging ME?

[He laughs]

RAZOR: This is the best entertainment
I've had all week.

LI WEI: I'm serious. One fight. If I win,
your gang leaves the Lower Streets. If
you win, you get whatever tribute you want.

RAZOR: (amused)
And why would I accept? I could just have
my boys kill you right now.

LI WEI: Because everyone's watching. And
if you refuse a direct challenge, what
does that say about you?

[Razor's smile freezes]

[The thugs mutter - Li Wei struck a nerve]

RAZOR: (coldly)
Fine. You want to die so badly?

[He cracks his knuckles]

RAZOR: Let's dance, beggar.

[The thugs form a circle - improvised arena]

[BOSS FIGHT: RAZOR - Begins]
```

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Phase 1: Probing

```
RAZOR: Not bad, beggar. Where'd you learn
to fight?

LI WEI: I don't remember.

RAZOR: (laughing)
Mysterious. I like it.

[He attacks - fast, precise]

RAZOR: But I've beaten better than you.

[Combat continues - Razor tests Li Wei's defenses]
[Good time to use Flowing Stance]

[At 60% HP:]

RAZOR: (wiping blood from lip)
Okay. You're real.

[His stance shifts - more serious]

RAZOR: Let me show you what REAL looks like.
```

### Phase 2: Serious

```
[Razor's attacks become faster, combo-heavy]
[He chains strikes together - hard to evade]

RAZOR: The streets taught me everything!
I EARNED my place!

[His fighting style is actually sophisticated -
suggesting hidden training]

RAZOR: You think you can just WALK IN and
take what's mine?!

[Combat continues - player needs to mix Flowing
and Weathered stances]

[At 30% HP:]

RAZOR: (staggering)
No... NO!

[His eyes go wild]

RAZOR: I didn't survive this long to lose
to a BEGGAR!

[He pulls a hidden knife]

RAZOR: Rules are for losers!
```

### Phase 3: Desperate

```
[Razor fights dirty - knife attacks, throws
debris, uses environment]

RAZOR: I'll cut you apart! I'll—

[Li Wei's pendant flares]

[INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:]
Something's happening. The pendant.
My chi. It's...

[Li Wei feels his chi flowing BACKWARD -
through inverse meridians]

[For a moment, everything is clear]

[SPECIAL: "Awakening" - One free critical hit]

[Player has opportunity for finishing blow]

[Victory:]

[Razor falls, knife clattering away]

RAZOR: (on the ground)
How... what ARE you?

LI WEI: I don't know yet.

[He looks at the watching thugs]

LI WEI: The deal stands. Leave the Lower
Streets. Don't come back.

[Long silence]

SCARRED JIN: (stepping forward)
Boss... boss, what do we do?

RAZOR: (bitterly)
You heard him. We're done here.

[He looks at Li Wei with hatred]

RAZOR: This isn't over, beggar. I'll
remember you.

[The gang disperses]

[Li Wei stands alone in the territory - victorious]

[SCENE 1.6A COMPLETE]
[Razor: DEFEATED]
[Street Status: Li Wei feared as fighter]
```

---

## Scene 1.6B: The Alliance Path (Stream Path)

**Duration:** 25 minutes (no boss fight, but complex social encounters)

### Gathering Allies

```
ELDER CHEN: Unite the gangs against Razor?
Ambitious.

ELDER WU: And difficult. They all hate
each other.

ELDER MEI: But they hate Razor MORE. He's
been absorbing everyone.

ELDER CHEN: (to Li Wei)
You'll need to convince them one by one.
The Bone Collectors. The Ratlings. What
remains of the old Iron Dogs.

[He pauses]

ELDER CHEN: Be careful. These are not
good people. They're just people with a
common enemy.
```

### The Bone Collectors

```
[BONE YARD TERRITORY - A different Bone Yard,
filled with human remains]

[The Bone Collectors deal in burial, cremation,
and occasionally, less legal body disposal]

MAMA BONE: (ancient woman, not related to
Grandmother Bone but similar aesthetic)
A beggar wants to talk? Talk.

LI WEI: I want to propose an alliance
against Razor.

MAMA BONE: (laughing)
Alliance? Against that psychopath?

[She stops laughing]

MAMA BONE: He killed three of my collectors
last month. Just for being in "his" territory.

LI WEI: Then help me stop him.

MAMA BONE: And what do WE get?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE:]
> [Offer: Their territory back] → Success
> [Offer: Protection from Beggars Sect] → Partial success
> [Threaten: Join or be next] → Failure, must fight

[If successful:]

MAMA BONE: Hmm. Territory. That's something.

[She studies Li Wei]

MAMA BONE: Fine. When you move against
Razor, the Collectors will block the
southern alleys. He won't be able to run.

[BONE COLLECTORS: Allied]
```

### The Ratlings

```
[SEWER ENTRANCE - A child-gang that lives in
the drainage system]

[RAT KING - A teenager covered in grime, eyes
sharp with survival]

RAT KING: You want our help? Us?

[He's suspicious - adults rarely offer deals
to children]

LI WEI: I want everyone who hates Razor
to stand together.

RAT KING: We don't fight. We're small.
We survive.

LI WEI: I'm not asking you to fight. I'm
asking you to watch. To report. To be my
eyes where I can't go.

[The Rat King considers]

RAT KING: And what do we get?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE:]
> [Offer: Food from the sect kitchen] → Success
> [Offer: Safe passage through sect territory] → Success
> [Offer: Training] → Great success, long-term ally

[If training offered:]

RAT KING: (eyes widening)
Training? Like, real fighting training?

LI WEI: If you want it.

RAT KING: (slowly)
Nobody ever offered to teach us anything.

[He extends a grimy hand]

RAT KING: Deal. The Ratlings are your eyes.

[RATLINGS: Allied + Future Contact]
```

### The Iron Dogs Remnant

```
[WAREHOUSE - A handful of scarred fighters,
remnants of the gang Razor conquered]

OLD IRON: (grizzled veteran)
Razor killed our leader. Took everything.
We've been waiting to hit back.

LI WEI: Then stand with me.

OLD IRON: (suspicious)
With a beggar? Against Razor? What makes
you think you can win?

[CHOICE:]
> [Demonstrate strength - brief combat] → Blade approach
> [Explain the alliance] → Stream approach
> [Reveal Razor's weakness] → Shadow approach

[If alliance explained:]

LI WEI: I have the Bone Collectors blocking
the south. The Ratlings watching every move.
And I have the Beggars Sect.

OLD IRON: (impressed despite himself)
You put all that together? In a few days?

LI WEI: We all want the same thing.

OLD IRON: (nodding slowly)
Fine. The Dogs will bite again. Just point
us at the target.

[IRON DOGS REMNANT: Allied]
```

### The Confrontation

```
[GANG TERRITORY - Night]

[Li Wei approaches, but this time he's not alone]
[Bone Collectors block the southern exit]
[Ratlings watch from the shadows]
[Iron Dogs stand behind Li Wei]

RAZOR: (emerging, seeing the situation)
What the hell is this?

LI WEI: Your options narrowing, Razor.

[Razor's thugs look around - they're surrounded]

RAZOR: (to his men)
Kill them all! We outnumber—

SCARRED JIN: Boss... we don't. Look.

[More figures emerge - the alliance is larger
than Razor realized]

RAZOR: (furious)
You think a bunch of rats and bones can
stop me?!

LI WEI: I think you have a choice. Leave
the Lower Streets peacefully. Or leave
in pieces.

[Razor's hand twitches toward his knife]

[MAMA BONE steps forward]

MAMA BONE: We handle bodies, Razor. One
more won't be a problem.

[OLD IRON cracks his knuckles]

OLD IRON: I've been waiting for this.

[Razor looks at his men - they're not ready
to die for him]

RAZOR: (through gritted teeth)
Fine. You win this round, beggar.

[He points at Li Wei]

RAZOR: But this isn't over. The streets
have long memories.

[He turns to leave]

RAZOR: Come on. We're relocating.

[His gang follows]

[Li Wei turns to his allies]

LI WEI: Thank you. All of you.

MAMA BONE: Don't thank us yet. You promised
things. Make sure you deliver.

[She walks away]

RAT KING: (to Li Wei, quietly)
That was cool. Really cool.

[The alliance disperses]

[Li Wei stands in the territory - victorious
through unity]

[SCENE 1.6B COMPLETE]
[Razor: ALLIED (forced truce)]
[Street Status: Li Wei known as diplomat]
```

---

## Scene 1.6C: The Shadow Path

**Duration:** 25 minutes (investigation and manipulation)

### The Investigation

```
ELDER CHEN: Find Razor's secrets? Dangerous.
But effective, if you can do it.

ELDER MEI: (leaning in)
I mentioned his upper ring connection.
Rumor is he worked for someone in the
Commerce Ring before he "became" Razor.

ELDER WU: If that's true, the Spartans
would love to know. Unauthorized gang
activity traced to a upper citizen?
That's scandal.

ELDER CHEN: (to Li Wei)
Be careful. If Razor catches you digging,
he won't challenge you to a duel.
He'll just kill you.

LI WEI: I'll be careful.
```

### Investigation Phase

```
[LOWER STREETS - Night]

[Li Wei moves through shadows, gathering
information]

[INVESTIGATION POINT 1: Scarred Jin]

[Scarred Jin drinks alone at a broken fountain]

[Stealth check - Li Wei listens]

SCARRED JIN: (muttering drunkenly)
...stupid beggar... shouldn't have come
to our territory... boss is gonna be mad...

[He drinks]

SCARRED JIN: ...boss is always mad these
days. Ever since that messenger came
from up-ring...

[He looks around nervously]

SCARRED JIN: ...shouldn't talk about that.
Boss said never talk about the Jade people.

[He passes out]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
"Jade people." Jade Cloud Sect is based
in the Commerce Ring. Are they connected
to Razor?

[CLUE: "Jade Connection" obtained]

[INVESTIGATION POINT 2: Razor's Quarters]

[Li Wei infiltrates Razor's hideout while
the gang is out patrolling]

[Stealth sequences - avoiding guards]

[Inside Razor's room:]

[A hidden compartment in the floor]

[Inside: Letters]

LETTER 1:
"Your payment for this month has been
received. Continue territorial expansion
as discussed. The merchandise will flow
through your area. Do not fail us.
- J.C."

LETTER 2:
"The Beggars Sect may be in your area.
Flush them out. There may be someone
among them we're looking for. Bring any
jade pendants you find.
- J.C."

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
They're looking for me. The pendant.
Whoever "J.C." is, they know about me.

And Razor works for them.

[CLUE: "Jade Cloud Connection" obtained]
[CLUE: "Initiative Interest" obtained]

[INVESTIGATION POINT 3: The Messenger]

[A Commerce Ring messenger arrives at gang
territory]

[Li Wei follows at a distance]

[The messenger meets with Razor in secret]

MESSENGER: The Jade Cloud Trade Master
grows impatient. Where is the subject
you were told to find?

RAZOR: (defensive)
I'm looking! The Lower Streets are a
maze. The beggars hide well.

MESSENGER: Then look harder. The Initiative
is offering substantial payment for
Subject 17's return.

RAZOR: What's so special about one beggar?

MESSENGER: (coldly)
That's not your concern. Find them.

[The messenger leaves]

RAZOR: (to himself, bitter)
"Find them." Like I'm some errand boy.

[He kicks a wall]

RAZOR: I'm RAZOR! I run these streets!
I'm not anyone's servant!

[Li Wei has heard enough]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
The Initiative. They're using Jade Cloud
Trade Master to fund Razor. To find me.

But Razor doesn't LIKE being used.
And the Spartans would LOVE to know that
a High Sect is funding gang activity.

I have everything I need.
```

### The Blackmail

```
[GANG TERRITORY - Night]

[Li Wei walks in openly - Razor's thugs
immediately surround him]

RAZOR: (emerging)
You've got nerve, beggar.

LI WEI: I have more than nerve. I have
information.

[He pulls out the letters]

RAZOR: (face going pale)
Where did you—

LI WEI: Your connection to Jade Cloud.
Your funding from the Initiative. Your
orders to find "Subject 17."

[He lets that sink in]

LI WEI: The Spartans would find this
very interesting, don't you think?

RAZOR: (fury building)
You're dead. You're SO dead—

LI WEI: If I die, these letters go public.
To the Spartans. To the other gangs.
To everyone.

[Razor stops]

LI WEI: How long would you last if everyone
knew you were a puppet? If the Iron Dogs
remnant knew you sold out to upper-ringers?

[Razor's thugs shift uncomfortably]

RAZOR: (through gritted teeth)
What do you want?

LI WEI: Leave. The Lower Streets, the
Beggars Sect, all of it. Go somewhere
else. And when your Jade Cloud masters
ask about Subject 17, tell them you
found nothing.

RAZOR: (hatred burning)
And the letters?

LI WEI: Disappear, and so do they.

[Long silence]

RAZOR: (finally)
Fine. You win.

[He turns to his men]

RAZOR: We're leaving. Tonight.

SCARRED JIN: But boss—

RAZOR: (cutting him off)
TONIGHT!

[He looks back at Li Wei]

RAZOR: This isn't over.

LI WEI: Yes it is. You just don't know
it yet.

[Razor leaves]

[The gang follows]

[Li Wei stands alone - victorious through
information and manipulation]

[SCENE 1.6C COMPLETE]
[Razor: EXILED]
[Street Status: Li Wei's role hidden]
[FLAG: Know about Jade Cloud connection]
[FLAG: Know Initiative is hunting Subject 17]
```

## Scene 1.7: Aftermath

**Type:** Consequences & Setup
**Varies based on path taken**

### Blade Path Aftermath

```
[BEGGAR'S CORNER - The next day]

[Li Wei returns to celebration]

BROTHER FENG: You DID it! You actually beat
Razor!

[The disciples crowd around]

ELDER WU: (pushing through)
Enough. Give him air.

[She looks at Li Wei appraisingly]

ELDER WU: You fought well. But you've made
yourself visible. Word will spread.

ELDER CHEN: (arriving)
A beggar who defeated a gang leader?
The Spartans will hear. They always hear.

LI WEI: Let them.

ELDER CHEN: (sighing)
The confidence of youth.

[He places a hand on Li Wei's shoulder]

ELDER CHEN: Enjoy your victory. But
prepare yourself. This was the beginning,
not the end.

[Elsewhere - Garrison Ring]

SPARTAN OFFICER: Commander Vex? Reports
from the Lower Streets. A vagrant defeated
the gang leader Razor in single combat.

COMMANDER VEX: A vagrant? Interesting.

[He looks at a file on his desk - Subject 17]

COMMANDER VEX: Begin surveillance.

[CHAPTER 1 COMPLETE - Blade Path]
```

### Stream Path Aftermath

```
[BEGGAR'S CORNER - The next day]

[The alliance members visit - a tense but
hopeful gathering]

MAMA BONE: You kept your word about
territory. The Collectors are satisfied.

RAT KING: (eating, happily)
This food is AMAZING. When can we come
back?

OLD IRON: (to Li Wei)
You did something nobody else could.
United people who hate each other.

ELDER CHEN: (to Li Wei privately)
What you built today may not last. Alliances
are fragile.

LI WEI: But they're something. Better than
fighting alone.

ELDER CHEN: (nodding)
Perhaps. We shall see.

[Elsewhere - Garrison Ring]

SPARTAN OFFICER: Commander Vex? Reports
of unusual activity in the Lower Streets.
Gang territories shifting. Possible
organization among vagrants.

COMMANDER VEX: Organization? Among beggars?

[He frowns]

COMMANDER VEX: Watch them. Something's
changing down there.

[CHAPTER 1 COMPLETE - Stream Path]
```

### Shadow Path Aftermath

```
[BEGGAR'S CORNER - The next day]

[Li Wei returns quietly - few know what happened]

ELDER CHEN: (finding Li Wei alone)
You succeeded. Without a single blow.

LI WEI: Information is a weapon.

ELDER CHEN: (studying him)
Indeed. And you've learned to wield it.

[He pauses]

ELDER CHEN: You also learned things.
About the Initiative. About who hunts you.

LI WEI: "Subject 17." That's what they
call me. They're paying Jade Cloud to
find me.

ELDER CHEN: (gravely)
The Calibration Initiative does not
abandon its subjects. You've escaped
something no one escapes.

LI WEI: Why? What am I to them?

ELDER CHEN: That... is what you must
discover. When you're ready.

[Elsewhere - Garrison Ring]

SPARTAN OFFICER: Commander Vex? The
Razor gang has left the Lower Streets.
No apparent cause.

COMMANDER VEX: Just... left?

SPARTAN OFFICER: Witnesses say nothing
happened. They simply relocated overnight.

COMMANDER VEX: (suspicious)
Nothing happens for no reason. Find out
why.

[CHAPTER 1 COMPLETE - Shadow Path]
