## Scene 1.1: The Void

**Type:** Cutscene (pre-rendered/text only)
**Location:** Abstract void / memory fragments
**Player Input:** None

### Purpose
- Create mystery and intrigue
- Plant seeds of Li Wei's hidden past
- Establish the game's tone

### Script

```
[BLACK SCREEN]

[Distant voices, overlapping, incomprehensible]

VOICE 1: (clinical) "Subject 17 is responding..."

VOICE 2: (urgent) "The readings are off the scale!"

VOICE 3: (panicked) "Shut it down! SHUT IT DOWN!"

[FLASH OF WHITE]
[Fragmentary images: sterile walls, masked figures, a jade pendant glowing]

[SILENCE]

[FADE TO BLACK]

[Beat]

NARRATOR TEXT:
You dream of white rooms and whispered numbers.
Of hands that measured but never touched.
Of something inside you, waiting.

You dream of running.
Of an explosion of... something.
Of falling.

You dream of forgetting.

[LONGER BEAT]

Then you wake.

[FADE TO SCENE 1.2]
```

### Design Notes
- These fragments will make sense only in Chapter 2-3
- Voice 1 is a Calibration Initiative researcher
- The jade pendant appears here before player knows its significance
- Creates hook: "What happened to me?"

---

## Scene 1.2: Awakening

**Type:** Interactive Cutscene → Exploration
**Location:** Unknown Alley (dead end off Lower Streets)
**Player Input:** Movement tutorial begins

### Environment Description

The alley is narrow and dark despite it being midday. Garbage piles against the walls. A rusted drainage pipe drips steadily. The air smells of rot and old rain. Li Wei lies among discarded refuse, barely distinguishable from it.

Beyond the alley's mouth: the sounds of a city. Voices. Footsteps. Life continuing without caring about another body in the gutters.

### Script

```
[FADE IN to Li Wei's perspective - blurry, slowly focusing]

[The player sees: grey sky above, stone walls on either side, garbage nearby]

INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:
...

Where...

[The view sharpens]

Where am I?

[Li Wei sits up slowly. The player sees his hands—dirty, scraped, unfamiliar to him]

These hands. Are they mine?

[He looks around the alley]

I don't... I don't remember how I got here.

I don't remember anything.

[Beat]

Wait. There's something.

[Li Wei touches his chest, finds the jade pendant]

This pendant. It feels... important.

[He examines it: a jade disc with a twisted spiral symbol]

But I don't know why.

[He tries to remember—pain flashes behind his eyes]

Gah!

[The pain passes]

Nothing. Just pain when I try to remember.

[He stands, unsteady]

I need to... to figure out where I am.

[GAMEPLAY BEGINS]
[Tutorial Prompt: "Use [ARROW KEYS/WASD] to move"]
```

### Interactions Available

**The Pendant:**
> A jade disc on a simple cord. The surface shows a spiral pattern that seems to twist inward forever. It's warm to the touch—warmer than it should be. Looking at it makes your head hurt.

**The Alley Walls:**
> Grimy stone slick with moisture. Graffiti in faded paint—gang signs? Warnings? The symbols mean nothing to you.

**The Garbage Pile:**
> Rotting vegetables, torn cloth, broken things. Someone's discarded life. You feel an odd kinship with it.

**The Alley Exit:**
> Beyond the narrow passage: movement, voices, the suggestion of a street. Whatever waits out there, it has to be better than this dead end.

### Trigger to Scene 1.3
Player moves to alley exit

---

## Scene 1.3: First Steps

**Type:** Exploration (open area)
**Location:** Lower Streets - Initial Area
**Player Input:** Free movement, NPC interaction

### Environment Description

The Lower Streets assault the senses. Narrow pathways wind between crumbling buildings. Vendors sell questionable food from blankets spread on the ground. People move with purpose—most avoiding eye contact, some eyeing Li Wei with calculation.

The buildings lean overhead, blocking most of the sky. It feels like being at the bottom of a canyon made of poverty.

### Interactive NPCs

**Street Vendor (won't engage):**
```
LI WEI: Excuse me, can you tell me—

VENDOR: [Doesn't look up]
No coin, no talk. Move along, beggar.

LI WEI: But I just need to know—

VENDOR: I said MOVE. You're scaring off customers.

[The vendor makes a shooing gesture]
```

**Hurrying Worker (dismissive):**
```
LI WEI: Please, I need help. I don't know where—

WORKER: [Brushing past]
Don't we all.

[They're gone before Li Wei can respond]
```

**Huddled Beggar (paranoid):**
```
[Li Wei approaches a figure in rags huddled against a wall]

LI WEI: Hello? Are you—

BEGGAR: [Flinches away]
Stay back! Mine! It's MINE!

[The beggar clutches something unseen to their chest]

I don't have anything you want! Leave me alone!

LI WEI: I wasn't trying to—

BEGGAR: LEAVE!

[The beggar scrambles away, muttering]
```

**Child (curious then scared):**
```
[A small child stares at Li Wei from a doorway]

LI WEI: Hey there. Do you know—

[An adult hand yanks the child inside]

PARENT: [From within]
Stay away from the vagrant!

[Door slams]
```

### Narrative Text (appears as player explores)

> No one will help you. Why would they? In the Lower Streets, helping a stranger is an invitation to be exploited.

> You don't recognize anything. Not the buildings, not the streets, not the dialect. Were you ever here before?

> Your stomach growls. When did you last eat? You can't remember that either.

> People look through you like you're made of glass. Or garbage.

### Trigger to Scene 1.4
Player enters specific back alley (marked by different lighting/atmosphere)

---

## Scene 1.4: Survival Instinct

**Type:** Tutorial Combat
**Location:** Back Alley
**Player Input:** Combat tutorial (guided)

### Purpose
- Introduce combat system basics
- Show that Li Wei has hidden instincts
- Create first real threat

### Pre-Combat Script

```
[Li Wei enters a narrow alley, hoping for a shortcut or privacy]

[Three figures block the far exit. Two more appear behind him]

THUG 1: Well, well. Fresh meat.

[The leader steps forward—SCARRED JIN, his burned face twisted in a grin]

SCARRED JIN: You're new around here, aren't you? Didn't anyone tell you about the toll?

LI WEI: Toll? I don't have anything—

SCARRED JIN: Everyone has SOMETHING.

[Jin gestures. The thugs close in]

SCARRED JIN: That pendant looks nice. Hand it over, and maybe we just rough you up a little.

[Li Wei's hand goes to the pendant instinctively]

LI WEI: No. I... I can't.

[He doesn't know why, but he can't give it up]

SCARRED JIN: [Laughs]
Wrong answer.

[Jin cracks his knuckles]

SCARRED JIN: Boys, teach our friend about the Lower Streets.

[COMBAT TUTORIAL BEGINS]
```

### Combat Tutorial Flow

**Phase 1: Basic Attack**
```
[Tutorial overlay]
SYSTEM: "You've never fought before. But something inside you knows what to do."
SYSTEM: "Press [ATTACK] to strike."

[Player attacks. Li Wei throws an instinctive palm strike—not trained, but surprisingly effective]

THUG: Gah! He hit me!

SCARRED JIN: Lucky shot. Get him!
```

**Phase 2: Defense**
```
[A thug winds up an obvious attack]
SYSTEM: "Press [DEFEND] before an attack lands to reduce damage and build Chi."

[Player defends successfully]

LI WEI: (thinking) How did I know to do that?
```

**Phase 3: Chi Building**
```
SYSTEM: "Chi is your fighting spirit. Build it through combat to use powerful techniques."
SYSTEM: "Right now you only know basic Palm Strike."

[Player uses Palm Strike when Chi allows]

[The attack feels... right. Like remembering something he'd forgotten]
```

**Phase 4: Taking Damage**
```
[A thug lands a hit on Li Wei]

SYSTEM: "When your HP reaches 0, you fall. Watch your health."

LI WEI: (thinking) It hurts, but... not as much as it should?
```

### Combat Resolution

**If player "wins" (unlikely first playthrough):**
```
[The thugs back off, surprised]

SCARRED JIN: Tch. You got moves, beggar. But this isn't over.

[Jin spits at Li Wei's feet]

SCARRED JIN: You're on Razor's turf now. And Razor doesn't forget.

[The thugs retreat]

LI WEI: (thinking) Razor? Who—

[Li Wei collapses, exhausted]
```

**More likely outcome (player loses or fight is scripted to end):**
```
[Li Wei is overwhelmed—too many, too fast, too inexperienced]

[He goes down]

SCARRED JIN: [Reaching for the pendant]
Now let's see what you were protecting—

VOICE: [From darkness]
ENOUGH.

[The thugs freeze. A figure emerges from the shadows—OLD DAO, blind, ancient, holding a wooden bowl]

OLD DAO: This one is not your prey, Jin.

SCARRED JIN: [Sneering]
Stay out of this, old man. Unless you want what he's getting.

OLD DAO: [Quietly]
You misunderstand. I'm not asking.

[Something shifts. The air grows heavy. Jin's sneer falters]

SCARRED JIN: (muttering) ...Tch. He's not worth the trouble anyway.

[The thugs withdraw, Jin glaring back]

SCARRED JIN: [To Li Wei]
This isn't over.

[They're gone]

[Old Dao approaches the fallen Li Wei]

OLD DAO: Can you stand, young one?

LI WEI: [Struggling]
I... I think so.

OLD DAO: Good. Come with me. There are people you need to meet.

[Old Dao helps Li Wei up]

LI WEI: Who... who are you?

OLD DAO: [Smiling faintly]
Someone who's been waiting for you.

[FADE TO SCENE 1.5]
```

### Design Notes
- Player SHOULD feel outmatched—this sets up the training arc
- Old Dao's intervention shows the sect has been watching
- Scarred Jin's appearance foreshadows him as recurring rival
- "This isn't over" directly sets up Chapter 1 boss confrontation

---

## Scene 1.5: Days of Nothing

**Type:** Narrative Montage (minimal player input)
**Location:** Various Lower Streets locations
**Player Input:** Occasional prompts

### Purpose
- Show passage of time
- Build empathy through hardship
- Contrast the "before" of isolation with "after" of sect

### Montage Script

```
[FADE IN - Day 1]

[Old Dao has vanished as mysteriously as he appeared. Li Wei is alone again.]

NARRATOR TEXT:
You wait where he left you. He said someone would come.

No one comes.

[FADE]

[Day 2 - Li Wei shelters in a doorway during rain]

NARRATOR TEXT:
The rain comes and doesn't stop.
You learn that the Lower Streets have no dry places for those with nowhere to go.

[PROMPT: "Press any key to endure"]

[Day 3 - Li Wei's stomach growls painfully]

NARRATOR TEXT:
Hunger becomes a constant companion.
You learn what it means to truly want.

[Li Wei finds a discarded crust. A moment of decision.]

[PROMPT: "Take it?"]

[If yes:]
The bread is stale and tastes of garbage.
It's the best thing you've ever eaten.
At least, the best thing you can remember.

[Day 4 - Night in a cold alley]

NARRATOR TEXT:
Sleep brings the dreams again.
White rooms. Numbers. Running.
You wake grasping at memories that dissolve like smoke.

[Day 5 - Li Wei's reflection in a dirty puddle]

NARRATOR TEXT:
You catch your reflection.
You don't recognize the face.
Sunken eyes. Hollow cheeks. The look of someone forgotten.

Is this who you are? Or who you're becoming?

[Day 6 - Other beggars watch Li Wei from a distance]

NARRATOR TEXT:
Sometimes you see others watching.
Ragged figures who look like you look now.
They keep their distance. But they're watching.

[Day 7 - Old Dao appears again]

[Li Wei, exhausted, sits against a wall. Old Dao approaches]

OLD DAO: Seven days. Not bad.

LI WEI: [Weakly]
You... you left me.

OLD DAO: I tested you. You endured.

[Old Dao offers his hand]

OLD DAO: The path chose well. Come. It's time.

[FADE TO SCENE 1.6]
```

### Design Notes
- The seven days mirror traditional "trial" narratives
- Player engagement through prompts keeps them active without demanding combat
- Establishes that Li Wei now LOOKS like a beggar
- Old Dao's test ensures only those with survival instinct find the sect

---

## Scene 1.6: The Old Blind Man

**Type:** Cutscene with Light Interaction
**Location:** Beggar's Corner → Path to Training Ground
**Player Input:** Dialogue choices (minor)

### Walking Dialogue with Old Dao

```
[Li Wei follows Old Dao through winding streets]

OLD DAO: You have questions. Ask them.

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "Who are you?"
> "Where are we going?"
> "Why did you help me?"

---

[IF: "Who are you?"]
OLD DAO: I am Dao. Some call me Old Dao. I am a beggar.

LI WEI: But that thing you did with the thugs—

OLD DAO: A beggar can be many things, young one. Society has forgotten this. We help them remember.

---

[IF: "Where are we going?"]
OLD DAO: Somewhere that doesn't exist. A place that official maps have never shown. The sanctuary of those the world has discarded.

LI WEI: A sanctuary?

OLD DAO: A sect. A family. A second chance.

---

[IF: "Why did you help me?"]
OLD DAO: Because you needed help. And because...

[Old Dao pauses, his blind eyes somehow meeting Li Wei's]

OLD DAO: ...you have a familiar hunger in you. The kind that can change worlds.

---

[Continuing conversation]

LI WEI: I don't remember anything. Where I'm from, who I was—

OLD DAO: Perhaps that's for the best.

[Old Dao leads Li Wei through a hidden passage]

OLD DAO: The past can be a prison. But the future... the future is an empty bowl, waiting to be filled.

[They emerge into the Training Ground]

OLD DAO: Welcome, Li Wei, to the Beggars Sect.

[The Training Ground spreads before them—a hidden courtyard with ancient architecture, other beggars moving about, a sense of community]

OLD DAO: The elders will decide if you stay. But know this...

[Old Dao turns, and despite his blindness, Li Wei feels SEEN]

OLD DAO: The path chose you. Not the other way around.

[Old Dao bows slightly and walks away, vanishing into the shadows]

LI WEI: Wait! What do you—

[He's gone]

VOICE: So. You're the one Dao found.

[Li Wei turns. ELDER CHEN approaches, warm smile on his weathered face]

ELDER CHEN: He has a talent for finding strays. Let me look at you.

[SCENE TRANSITIONS TO 1.7]
```

---

## Scene 1.7: The Hidden Family

**Type:** Dialogue Heavy (Character Introductions)
**Location:** Training Ground - Elder's Circle
**Player Input:** Dialogue responses

### The Elder Meeting

```
[Elder Chen studies Li Wei. Behind him, two more figures emerge:]
[ELDER WU - stern, muscular woman with short grey hair]
[ELDER MEI - wiry woman with wild hair, chewing dried meat]

ELDER CHEN: I am Chen. First Elder. These are my fellow keepers of the old ways.

ELDER WU: [Arms crossed]
Wu. I train those worth training.

ELDER MEI: [Bouncing slightly]
Mei! I'm Mei! Ooh, you look HUNGRY. Good. Hungry is good. Do you feel hungry? Of course you do, look at you!

ELDER CHEN: [Gently]
Mei. Let him breathe.

[Elder Chen circles Li Wei slowly]

ELDER CHEN: You found your way to the Lower Streets without memory. Survived a week without training. And Dao saw something in you worth saving.

[He pauses]

ELDER CHEN: What do you remember?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "Nothing. Just my name."
> "Fragments. Dreams of white rooms."
> "Pain. Running. A flash of light."

---

[IF: "Nothing. Just my name."]
ELDER CHEN: Li Wei. A good name. "Strength through Righteousness." Though perhaps you chose it yourself, when you had nothing else.

LI WEI: I didn't choose it. It was just... there. In the emptiness.

ELDER CHEN: [Nodding slowly]
Sometimes we know truths we cannot explain.

---

[IF: "Fragments. Dreams of white rooms."]
[The elders exchange a glance]

ELDER CHEN: White rooms?

ELDER WU: [Sharply]
The Spire keeps white rooms.

ELDER MEI: Research! Experiments! Nasty things to nasty people!

ELDER CHEN: [Raising a hand]
We won't press. Your past is your own. But know—if you come from where we suspect... you have more enemies than you realize.

---

[IF: "Pain. Running. A flash of light."]
ELDER CHEN: An escape, then. From what, you don't know. To where, you don't know.

[He nods thoughtfully]

ELDER CHEN: The path of the beggar often begins in flight. You ran from something. Perhaps here, you can stop running.

---

[CONTINUING]

ELDER WU: [Stepping forward]
Enough philosophy. Can he fight?

ELDER CHEN: He survived Jin's welcome. That suggests instinct.

ELDER MEI: Instinct without training is a blade without a handle! Dangerous! Might cut the wrong person! Probably yourself!

ELDER WU: Then we test him.

[Wu takes a fighting stance]

ELDER WU: Hit me.

LI WEI: What?

ELDER WU: I said HIT me. No technique. No training. Just hit me as hard as you can.

[Li Wei looks uncertain]

ELDER CHEN: [Gently]
Do as she asks. Show us what you are.

[Li Wei throws a punch. Wu deflects it effortlessly, guiding his momentum to send him tumbling]

ELDER WU: [Unimpressed]
No power. No focus. Sloppy. Desperate.

[She extends a hand to help him up]

ELDER WU: But you didn't hesitate. And your chi...

[She frowns]

ELDER WU: Your chi is strange. Backwards almost.

ELDER MEI: [Excited]
INVERSE! I knew it! Look at his flow, Chen! It's all— [gestures wildly] —wibbly-wobbly!

ELDER CHEN: [To Li Wei]
Li Wei. Would you like to learn what you might become?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "Yes. Teach me everything."
> "I don't understand what you're offering."
> "Will it help me remember who I am?"

---

[All paths lead to:]

ELDER CHEN: [Smiling warmly]
Welcome to the Beggars Sect, Li Wei. Welcome to your new family.

[BROTHER FENG approaches, grinning]

BROTHER FENG: Does this mean I get a training partner? Finally! I'm Feng, by the way. Don't let Elder Wu scare you. Her bark is worse than—actually, no. Her bite is pretty bad too.

ELDER WU: Feng.

BROTHER FENG: [Snapping to attention]
Yes, Elder!

ELDER CHEN: [Chuckling]
Come. Your training begins now.

[SCENE TRANSITIONS TO 1.8]
```

---

## Scene 1.8: The First Lesson

**Type:** Training Combat (Full Tutorial)
**Location:** Training Ground
**Player Input:** Full combat mechanics

### Setup

```
[The Training Ground's combat circle—a ring of worn stones]

ELDER CHEN: The palm is not a weapon, Li Wei. It is a conversation.

[He demonstrates a flowing motion]

ELDER CHEN: In the Flowing Stance, we speak softly. We adapt. We redirect.

[He gestures for Li Wei to enter the circle]

ELDER CHEN: Brother Feng will be your partner. He will attack. You will learn to flow.

BROTHER FENG: [Taking position]
Don't worry, I'll go easy—

ELDER WU: [From sidelines]
No, you won't.

BROTHER FENG: [Sighing]
...I won't go easy.

[TRAINING COMBAT BEGINS]
```

### Training Phases

**Phase 1: Stance Understanding**
```
SYSTEM: "The Flowing Stance prioritizes adaptability. Your Speed increases but Defense decreases."
SYSTEM: "Flowing techniques build Chi quickly but deal moderate damage."

[Li Wei is placed in Flowing Stance automatically]

ELDER CHEN: Feel how your weight shifts. You are water, finding the path of least resistance.
```

**Phase 2: Flowing Strike**
```
[After exchanging basic attacks]

ELDER CHEN: Good. Now, channel your chi into the strike. Let it flow from your core through your palm.

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Flowing Strike]

SYSTEM: "Flowing Strike: 20 Power, 15 Chi Cost. Moderate damage with +10% Chi gain."

[Li Wei uses Flowing Strike successfully]

BROTHER FENG: Ow! Hey, that actually stung!

ELDER CHEN: [Pleased]
The river begins to flow.
```

**Phase 3: Stream Palm**
```
ELDER CHEN: But water is not only gentle. A stream becomes a flood. Multiple strikes, continuous flow.

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Stream Palm]

SYSTEM: "Stream Palm: 15 Power ×3 hits, 25 Chi Cost. Multi-hit attack for building momentum."

[Li Wei uses Stream Palm]

BROTHER FENG: Three hits! How is he already—

ELDER CHEN: [Quietly]
Because he remembers, even when he doesn't know he remembers.
```

**Phase 4: Ripple Guard**
```
ELDER CHEN: Now, defense. But not rigid. A ripple absorbs impact and returns it.

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Ripple Guard]

SYSTEM: "Ripple Guard: 30 Chi Cost. High defense, reflects 25% damage if hit."

[Feng attacks. Li Wei uses Ripple Guard. Damage reflected]

BROTHER FENG: OW! It hit me back!

ELDER CHEN: [Laughing]
The student learns to return what he's given.
```

### Combat Resolution

```
[The spar ends. Li Wei stands, breathing hard but standing]

ELDER CHEN: Enough for today.

[He approaches Li Wei, placing a hand on his shoulder]

ELDER CHEN: You have potential, Li Wei. More than potential. But potential alone means nothing. It must be shaped by discipline.

[He gestures to Elder Wu]

ELDER CHEN: Tomorrow, Wu will teach you the Weathered path. And then... we'll see what kind of beggar you become.

BROTHER FENG: [Rubbing his shoulder]
Good spar, new guy. Though I was definitely holding back.

ELDER WU: You weren't.

BROTHER FENG: [Deflating]
...I wasn't.

[SCENE ENDS]
```

### Techniques Unlocked This Scene
- Flowing Strike
- Stream Palm
- Ripple Guard

## Scene 1.9: The Second Teacher

**Type:** Training Combat (Advanced)
**Location:** Training Ground - Stone Circle
**Player Input:** Combat with new stance

### Setup

```
[The next morning. Elder Wu stands in a different training area—a circle of stone pillars]

ELDER WU: Chen taught you to flow. I will teach you to STAND.

[She takes a rooted stance]

ELDER WU: The Weathered Stance is not about dodging. It's about enduring. Taking the blow and still standing.

[She gestures]

ELDER WU: Hit me.

LI WEI: Again?

ELDER WU: You couldn't before. Let's see if you can now.

[Li Wei attacks. Wu doesn't dodge—she shifts slightly, absorbing the blow]

ELDER WU: [Unmoved]
Better. But not good enough.

[TRAINING COMBAT BEGINS]
```

### Training Phases

**Phase 1: Stance Switching**
```
SYSTEM: "Press [STANCE] to switch between Flowing and Weathered Stance."
SYSTEM: "Weathered Stance: +20% Defense, -10% Speed. Built to endure."

ELDER WU: Switch between them. A true beggar knows when to flow and when to weather.

[Player practices stance switching]
```

**Phase 2: Weathered Palm**
```
ELDER WU: In Weathered Stance, your palm becomes a mountain. Slow, but immovable.

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Weathered Palm]

SYSTEM: "Weathered Palm: 30 Power, 25 Chi Cost. Slower but hits harder. +15% Defense after use."

[Li Wei uses Weathered Palm]

ELDER WU: [Slight nod]
Adequate. You hit like a small mountain. We'll make it larger.
```

**Phase 3: Steadfast Guard**
```
ELDER WU: When you cannot avoid a blow, accept it. Turn their strength into your resolve.

[TECHNIQUE UNLOCK: Steadfast Guard]

SYSTEM: "Steadfast Guard: 35 Chi Cost. Major damage reduction. Converts 50% damage taken to Chi."

ELDER WU: The more they hurt you, the stronger you become. That is the beggar's way. We have endured generations of pain. We turn it into power.
```

**Phase 4: Chi Management**
```
ELDER WU: Watch your chi. A beggar with empty chi is just a beggar. A beggar with full chi is a weapon.

[The training focuses on building and spending Chi efficiently]

ELDER WU: Never fight at empty. Never waste at full. Balance, even in the storm.
```

### Combat Resolution

```
[The training intensifies until Li Wei lands a solid Weathered Palm on the practice dummy]

ELDER WU: [A rare almost-smile]
You learn quickly. Too quickly. It makes me suspicious.

[She steps close]

ELDER WU: But suspicion isn't condemnation. Whatever you were before, whoever trained that body of yours... you're ours now.

[She places a hand on his shoulder—brief, firm]

ELDER WU: Don't disappoint us.

[She walks away]

[Elder Mei waves from nearby]

ELDER MEI: My turn next! But not today! Today you REST! Can't learn hungry if you're already EXHAUSTED! That's a different kind of hungry! A bad kind!

[SCENE ENDS]
```

## Scene 1.10: Brother

**Type:** Character Dialogue
**Location:** Training Ground - Rest Area
**Player Input:** Dialogue choices (relationship building)

### Purpose
- Build connection with Feng
- Establish friendship
- Add humor and humanity

### Script

```
[Night. Li Wei sits alone, looking at the jade pendant]

[Feng approaches, carrying two bowls of thin soup]

BROTHER FENG: You look like someone who needs food and conversation. I've got both.

[He sits, hands Li Wei a bowl]

BROTHER FENG: It's not much, but it's hot. Elder Wu says hunger builds character. I say hunger just makes me grumpy.

[They eat in silence for a moment]

BROTHER FENG: So. The mysterious amnesiac joins the secret sect of beggars. That's a story.

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "What's your story?"
> "I still don't understand what this place is."
> "Why is everyone here?"

---

[IF: "What's your story?"]
BROTHER FENG: Mine? Nothing special. Tested F-grade at birth, parents couldn't keep me, grew up in the streets.

[He shrugs]

BROTHER FENG: Found the sect at sixteen. Been here six years. They're the only family I've ever really had.

[He looks at Li Wei]

BROTHER FENG: Whatever you were before, man... this is a good place to figure out what you want to be.

---

[IF: "I still don't understand what this place is."]
BROTHER FENG: The Beggars Sect? We're... complicated.

[He gestures around]

BROTHER FENG: Officially, we don't exist. The world says F-grades can't learn martial arts. We say the world is wrong.

[He grins]

BROTHER FENG: We're proof that potential isn't everything. That someone society throws away can become something amazing.

BROTHER FENG: Also we're really good at surviving on nothing. Comes with the territory.

---

[IF: "Why is everyone here?"]
BROTHER FENG: Different reasons. Same story, mostly. Nobody wanted us. So we wanted each other.

[He finishes his soup]

BROTHER FENG: The elders took me in when I was starving. Taught me that being F-grade doesn't make me worthless. That the system is the problem, not us.

[He looks at Li Wei seriously]

BROTHER FENG: I don't know what you're running from, new guy. But you can stop running here.

---

[CONTINUING]

[A commotion at the entrance]

[A young beggar runs in, panicked]

YOUNG BEGGAR: Elders! ELDERS! It's Razor! He's demanding we hand over the new one!

[Feng's expression darkens]

BROTHER FENG: Razor? Jin must have told him about you.

LI WEI: The thug leader?

BROTHER FENG: Boss of every gang in the Lower Streets. Bad news, even for beggars.

[Elder Chen appears]

ELDER CHEN: [Calmly]
How many did he bring?

YOUNG BEGGAR: All of them, Elder. The whole gang.

[Elder Chen looks at Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: It seems your past has caught up with your present.

[He studies Li Wei]

ELDER CHEN: What do you want to do?

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "I won't let you fight my battles."
> "What would you have me do?"
> "This is about the pendant, isn't it?"

---

[All paths lead to:]

ELDER CHEN: The sect protects its own. But you are not wrong—this is your fight as much as ours.

[He nods slowly]

ELDER CHEN: Face Razor. Show him what a beggar can become. Show yourself what you can become.

[He places a hand on Li Wei's shoulder]

ELDER CHEN: Whatever happens, you are not alone anymore.

## Scene 1.11: Razor's Challenge

**Type:** Pre-Boss Cutscene
**Location:** Gang Territory - Border
**Player Input:** Minimal

### Environment Description

The boundary between Beggar's Corner and Gang Territory. A wide street lit by guttering torches. Razor stands in the center, surrounded by thugs. Scarred Jin smirks at his side.

The beggars line up behind Li Wei—not to fight, but to watch.

### Script

```
[Li Wei walks forward. The crowd parts]

[RAZOR steps forward—slicked-back hair, leather jacket, gold teeth glinting]

RAZOR: So this is the beggar who hurt my boy Jin.

[Razor circles Li Wei slowly]

RAZOR: You know who I am?

LI WEI: A bully with more thugs than skill.

[The thugs bristle. Razor laughs]

RAZOR: [Delighted]
I like this one! Got a mouth on him!

[The laughter dies]

RAZOR: [Cold]
But mouths get people killed around here.

[He stops circling]

RAZOR: Here's what's going to happen, beggar. You're going to give me that pretty pendant, apologize for embarrassing my lieutenant, and crawl back to whatever hole you came from.

RAZOR: Or...

[He cracks his knuckles]

RAZOR: Razor teaches you what happens to people who disrespect me.

[DIALOGUE CHOICE]
> "The pendant isn't yours to take."
> "I'm not afraid of you."
> [Say nothing. Adopt fighting stance.]

---

[IF: "The pendant isn't yours to take."]
RAZOR: [Amused]
Isn't mine? Everything in the Lower Streets is mine. The food, the protection, the garbage—and the beggars.

RAZOR: That includes you.

---

[IF: "I'm not afraid of you."]
RAZOR: [Grinning]
Not yet. But you will be.

---

[IF: Say nothing]
RAZOR: [Narrowing eyes]
Silent type, huh? Fine. Razor can do the talking for both of us.

---

[CONTINUING]

RAZOR: Boys, clear out. I'm going to enjoy this personally.

[The thugs fall back, forming a ring]

[Razor takes a fighting stance—brutal, street-taught, effective]

RAZOR: Come on, beggar. Show me what your cult taught you.

ELDER CHEN: [From the crowd]
Remember, Li Wei. You are the river. You are the mountain.

ELDER WU: [Firmly]
Don't die.

ELDER MEI: [Excited]
SHOW HIM WHAT HUNGRY MEANS!

[BOSS FIGHT BEGINS]
```

---

[IF: "Leave the beggars alone."]
RAZOR: [Spitting blood]
Fine. FINE. The beggars are off limits.

[He glares]

RAZOR: But you and me? We're not done. Razor doesn't forget.

---

[IF: "You never stood a chance."]
RAZOR: [Laughing bitterly]
Big talk from someone who was gutter trash a week ago.

[He stands shakily]

RAZOR: Enjoy this, beggar. It won't last.

---

[IF: Offer hand]
[Razor stares at the offered hand]

RAZOR: [Slapping it away]
Don't mock me.

[He stands alone]

RAZOR: This changes nothing. You hear me? NOTHING!

---

[CONTINUING]

[Razor retreats with his thugs. Scarred Jin throws one last hateful look at Li Wei]

SCARRED JIN: [Muttering]
Next time...

[The beggars cheer]

BROTHER FENG: [Running up]
That was INCREDIBLE! Did you see his face when—

[Elder Chen approaches, smiling]

ELDER CHEN: Well done, Li Wei. You've proven yourself today.

[He looks at the retreating gangs]

ELDER CHEN: But this is only the beginning. You've made enemies. And attracted attention.

[Elder Wu nods]

ELDER WU: The Spartans will hear of this. A beggar defeating a gang boss? They'll come investigating.

ELDER MEI: [Serious for once]
Bigger things are stirring, young one. Darker things.

[Elder Chen places both hands on Li Wei's shoulders]

ELDER CHEN: Rest tonight. Celebrate your victory. But tomorrow... we begin your real training.

[He looks toward the city's center—toward the distant Spire]

ELDER CHEN: Something tells me you'll need everything we can teach you.

[CHAPTER 1 ENDS]
